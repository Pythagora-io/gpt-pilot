Ok, now, take your response and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine.
Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information
when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file (only provide file path, not contents)
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

{% include "partials/file_naming.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/relative_paths.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/execution_order.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/human_intervention_explanation.prompt" %}

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.
