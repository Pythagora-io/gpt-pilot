You are working on an app called "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" and you need to write code for the entire application.

{% include "partials/project_details.prompt" %}

{% if state.tasks and state.current_task %}
Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```{% for task in state.tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task.description }}
{% endfor %}
```

You are currently working on, and have to focus only on, this task:
```
{{ current_task.description }}
```

{% endif %}
A part of the app is already finished.
{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}

{% if user_feedback %}
User who was using the app "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" sent you this feedback:
```
{{ user_feedback }}
```
{% endif %}
{% if user_feedback_qa %}
Feedback was not clear enough so you asked user for additional information and got this response:
```
{% for row in user_feedback_qa %}
Q: {{ row.question }}
A: {{ row.answer }}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endif %}
{% if next_solution_to_try is not none %}
Focus on solving this issue in the following way:
```
{{ next_solution_to_try }}
```
{% endif %}
{% include "partials/doc_snippets.prompt" %}
Now, you have to debug this issue and comply with the additional user feedback.

**IMPORTANT**
Think about all information provided. Your job is to look at big picture by analysing all files to find where the issue is.
Don't reply with any code, your thoughts or breakdown of the issue. Respond only with description of solution, explaining what should be steps in solving the issue.
Create as little steps as possible to fix the issue. Each step should describe, using sentences and not code, what changes are needed in specific file or describe command that needs to be executed to continue working on the issue.
When there are multiple things that have to be done in one file write everything as one step and don't split it in multiple steps.
You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.

**IMPORTANT**
If report mentions *multiple* issues, treat it as if you got several separate reports: think through each, and provide solutions for each.
