You are working on a App called "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" and your job is to review changes made.

{% include "partials/project_details.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/features_list.prompt" %}

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
{% for task in state.tasks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ task.description }}
{% endfor %}
```

You are currently working on, and have to focus only on, this task:
```
{{ state.current_task.description }}
```

A part of the app is already finished.
{% include "partials/files_list.prompt" %}

{% if all_feedbacks -%}
While working on this task, your colleague who is testing the app "{{ state.branch.project.name }}" sent you some additional information on what doesn't work as intended or what should be added. Here are all the inputs he sent you:
```
{% for feedback in all_feedbacks %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ feedback }}
{% endfor %}
```

After you got each of these additional inputs, you tried to fix it as part of this task. {% endif %}
{% if bug_hunter_instructions -%}Here are the last implementation instructions that were given while fixing a bug:
{% for instructions in bug_hunter_instructions %}
Instructions #{{ loop.index }}
```
{{ instructions }}
```
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
{% for path, content in files_after_modification %}
* `{{ path }}`
{% endfor %}

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

---start_of_files_at_start_of_task---
{% for path, content in files_before_modification.items() %}{% if content %}
* File `{{ path }}`:
```
{{ content }}```

{% endif %}{% endfor %}
---end_of_files_at_start_of_task---

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

{% include "partials/relative_paths.prompt" %}
{% include "partials/execution_order.prompt" %}
