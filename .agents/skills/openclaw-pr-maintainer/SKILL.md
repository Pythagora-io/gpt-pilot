# OpenClaw PR Maintainer

Use this skill for maintainer-facing GitHub workflow, not for ordinary code changes.

## Apply close and triage labels correctly

- If an issue or PR matches an auto-close reason, apply the label and let `.github/workflows/auto-response.yml` handle the comment/close/lock flow.
- Do not manually close plus manually comment for these reasons.
- `r:*` labels can be used on both issues and PRs.
- Current reasons:
  - `r: skill`
  - `r: support`
  - `r: no-ci-pr`
  - `r: too-many-prs`
  - `r: testflight`
  - `r: third-party-extension`
  - `r: moltbook`
  - `r: spam`
  - `invalid`
  - `dirty` for PRs only

## Enforce the bug-fix evidence bar

- Never merge a bug-fix PR based only on issue text, PR text, or AI rationale.
- Before landing, require:
  1. symptom evidence such as a repro, logs, or a failing test
  2. a verified root cause in code with file/line
  3. a fix that touches the implicated code path
  4. a regression test when feasible, or explicit manual verification plus a reason no test was added
- If the claim is unsubstantiated or likely wrong, request evidence or changes instead of merging.
- If the linked issue appears outdated or incorrect, correct triage first. Do not merge a speculative fix.

## Handle GitHub text safely

- For issue comments and PR comments, use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` for real newlines. Never embed `\n`.
- Do not use `gh issue/pr comment -b "..."` when the body contains backticks or shell characters. Prefer a single-quoted heredoc.
- Do not wrap issue or PR refs like `#24643` in backticks when you want auto-linking.
- PR landing comments should include clickable full commit links for landed and source SHAs when present.

## Search broadly before deciding

- Prefer targeted keyword search before proposing new work or closing something as duplicate.
- Use `--repo openclaw/openclaw` with `--match title,body` first.
- Add `--match comments` when triaging follow-up discussion.
- Do not stop at the first 500 results when the task requires a full search.

Examples:

```bash
gh search prs --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 -- "auto-update"
gh search issues --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 -- "auto-update"
gh search issues --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,state,url,updatedAt -- "auto update" \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number) | \(.state) | \(.title) | \(.url)"'
```

## Follow PR review and landing hygiene

- If bot review conversations exist on your PR, address them and resolve them yourself once fixed.
- Leave a review conversation unresolved only when reviewer or maintainer judgment is still needed.
- When landing or merging any PR, follow the global `/landpr` process.
- Use `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>` for scoped commits instead of manual `git add` and `git commit`.
- Keep commit messages concise and action-oriented.
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` for PR submissions and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for issues.

## Extra safety

- If a close or reopen action would affect more than 5 PRs, ask for explicit confirmation with the exact count and target query first.
- `sync` means: if the tree is dirty, commit all changes with a sensible Conventional Commit message, then `git pull --rebase`, then `git push`. Stop if rebase conflicts cannot be resolved safely.
