{% if files|length > 0 %}
Here is how files look now:
{% for file in files %}
**{{ file.path }}**
```{# file.language #}
{{ file.content }}
```

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Now, think step by step and apply the needed changes for step #{{ step_index }} - {{ step_description }}.

Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be added here by the user. Finally, you can save the modified files on the disk by calling `save_files` function.
