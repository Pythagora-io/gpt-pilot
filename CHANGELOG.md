## Unreleased

## 2026.3.12

### Changes

- Control UI/dashboard-v2: refresh the gateway dashboard with modular overview, chat, config, agent, and session views, plus a command palette, mobile bottom tabs, and richer chat tools like slash commands, search, export, and pinned messages. (#41503) Thanks @BunsDev.
- OpenAI/GPT-5.4 fast mode: add configurable session-level fast toggles across `/fast`, TUI, Control UI, and ACP, with per-model config defaults and OpenAI/Codex request shaping.
- Anthropic/Claude fast mode: map the shared `/fast` toggle and `params.fastMode` to direct Anthropic API-key `service_tier` requests, with live verification for both Anthropic and OpenAI fast-mode tiers.
- Models/plugins: move Ollama, vLLM, and SGLang onto the provider-plugin architecture, with provider-owned onboarding, discovery, model-picker setup, and post-selection hooks so core provider wiring is more modular.
- Docs/Kubernetes: Add a starter K8s install path with raw manifests, Kind setup, and deployment docs. Thanks @sallyom @dzianisv @egkristi
- Agents/subagents: add `sessions_yield` so orchestrators can end the current turn immediately, skip queued tool work, and carry a hidden follow-up payload into the next session turn. (#36537) thanks @jriff
- Slack/agent replies: support `channelData.slack.blocks` in the shared reply delivery path so agents can send Block Kit messages through standard Slack outbound delivery. (#44592) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Security/device pairing: switch `/pair` and `openclaw qr` setup codes to short-lived bootstrap tokens so the next release no longer embeds shared gateway credentials in chat or QR pairing payloads. Thanks @lintsinghua.
- Security/plugins: disable implicit workspace plugin auto-load so cloned repositories cannot execute workspace plugin code without an explicit trust decision. (`GHSA-99qw-6mr3-36qr`)(#44174) Thanks @lintsinghua and @vincentkoc.
- Models/Kimi Coding: send `anthropic-messages` tools in native Anthropic format again so `kimi-coding` stops degrading tool calls into XML/plain-text pseudo invocations instead of real `tool_use` blocks. (#38669, #39907, #40552) Thanks @opriz.
- TUI/chat log: reuse the active assistant message component for the same streaming run so `openclaw tui` no longer renders duplicate assistant replies. (#35364) Thanks @lisitan.
- Telegram/model picker: make inline model button selections persist the chosen session model correctly, clear overrides when selecting the configured default, and include effective fallback models in `/models` button validation. (#40105) Thanks @avirweb.
- Cron/proactive delivery: keep isolated direct cron sends out of the write-ahead resend queue so transient-send retries do not replay duplicate proactive messages after restart. (#40646) Thanks @openperf and @vincentkoc.
- Models/Kimi Coding: send the built-in `User-Agent: claude-code/0.1.0` header by default for `kimi-coding` while still allowing explicit provider headers to override it, so Kimi Code subscription auth can work without a local header-injection proxy. (#30099) Thanks @Amineelfarssi and @vincentkoc.
- Models/OpenAI Codex Spark: keep `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` working on the `openai-codex/*` path via resolver fallbacks and clearer Codex-only handling, while continuing to suppress the stale direct `openai/*` Spark row that OpenAI rejects live.
- Ollama/Kimi Cloud: apply the Moonshot Kimi payload compatibility wrapper to Ollama-hosted Kimi models like `kimi-k2.5:cloud`, so tool routing no longer breaks when thinking is enabled. (#41519) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Moonshot CN API: respect explicit `baseUrl` (api.moonshot.cn) in implicit provider resolution so platform.moonshot.cn API keys authenticate correctly instead of returning HTTP 401. (#33637) Thanks @chengzhichao-xydt.
- Kimi Coding/provider config: respect explicit `models.providers["kimi-coding"].baseUrl` when resolving the implicit provider so custom Kimi Coding endpoints no longer get overwritten by the built-in default. (#36353) Thanks @2233admin.
- Gateway/main-session routing: keep TUI and other `mode:UI` main-session sends on the internal surface when `deliver` is enabled, so replies no longer inherit the session's persisted Telegram/WhatsApp route. (#43918) Thanks @obviyus.
- BlueBubbles/self-chat echo dedupe: drop reflected duplicate webhook copies only when a matching `fromMe` event was just seen for the same chat, body, and timestamp, preventing self-chat loops without broad webhook suppression. Related to #32166. (#38442) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- iMessage/self-chat echo dedupe: drop reflected duplicate copies only when a matching `is_from_me` event was just seen for the same chat, text, and `created_at`, preventing self-chat loops without broad text-only suppression. Related to #32166. (#38440) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Subagents/completion announce retries: raise the default announce timeout to 90 seconds and stop retrying gateway-timeout failures for externally delivered completion announces, preventing duplicate user-facing completion messages after slow gateway responses. Fixes #41235. Thanks @vasujain00 and @vincentkoc.
- Mattermost/block streaming: fix duplicate message delivery (one threaded, one top-level) when block streaming is active by excluding `replyToId` from the block reply dedup key and adding an explicit `threading` dock to the Mattermost plugin. (#41362) Thanks @mathiasnagler and @vincentkoc.
- Mattermost/reply media delivery: pass agent-scoped `mediaLocalRoots` through shared reply delivery so allowed local files upload correctly from button, slash-command, and model-picker replies. (#44021) Thanks @LyleLiu666.
- macOS/Reminders: add the missing `NSRemindersUsageDescription` to the bundled app so `apple-reminders` can trigger the system permission prompt from OpenClaw.app. (#8559) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Gateway/session discovery: discover disk-only and retired ACP session stores under custom templated `session.store` roots so ACP reconciliation, session-id/session-label targeting, and run-id fallback keep working after restart. (#44176) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Plugins/env-scoped roots: fix plugin discovery/load caches and provenance tracking so same-process `HOME`/`OPENCLAW_HOME` changes no longer reuse stale plugin state or misreport `~/...` plugins as untracked. (#44046) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Models/OpenRouter native ids: canonicalize native OpenRouter model keys across config writes, runtime lookups, fallback management, and `models list --plain`, and migrate legacy duplicated `openrouter/openrouter/...` config entries forward on write.
- Windows/native update: make package installs use the npm update path instead of the git path, carry portable Git into native Windows updates, and mirror the installer's Windows npm env so `openclaw update` no longer dies early on missing `git` or `node-llama-cpp` download setup.
- Sandbox/write: preserve pinned mutation-helper payload stdin so sandboxed `write` no longer reports success while creating empty files. (#43876) Thanks @glitch418x.
- Security/exec approvals: escape invisible Unicode format characters in approval prompts so zero-width command text renders as visible `\u{...}` escapes instead of spoofing the reviewed command. (`GHSA-pcqg-f7rg-xfvv`)(#43687) Thanks @EkiXu and @vincentkoc.
- Hooks/loader: fail closed when workspace hook paths cannot be resolved with `realpath`, so unreadable or broken internal hook paths are skipped instead of falling back to unresolved imports. (#44437) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Hooks/agent deliveries: dedupe repeated hook requests by optional idempotency key so webhook retries can reuse the first run instead of launching duplicate agent executions. (#44438) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/exec detection: normalize compatibility Unicode and strip invisible formatting code points before obfuscation checks so zero-width and fullwidth command tricks no longer suppress heuristic detection. (`GHSA-9r3v-37xh-2cf6`)(#44091) Thanks @wooluo and @vincentkoc.
- Security/exec allowlist: preserve POSIX case sensitivity and keep `?` within a single path segment so exact-looking allowlist patterns no longer overmatch executables across case or directory boundaries. (`GHSA-f8r2-vg7x-gh8m`)(#43798) Thanks @zpbrent and @vincentkoc.
- Security/commands: require sender ownership for `/config` and `/debug` so authorized non-owner senders can no longer reach owner-only config and runtime debug surfaces. (`GHSA-r7vr-gr74-94p8`)(#44305) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Security/gateway auth: clear unbound client-declared scopes on shared-token WebSocket connects so device-less shared-token operators cannot self-declare elevated scopes. (`GHSA-rqpp-rjj8-7wv8`)(#44306) Thanks @LUOYEcode and @vincentkoc.
- Security/browser.request: block persistent browser profile create/delete routes from write-scoped `browser.request` so callers can no longer persist admin-only browser profile changes through the browser control surface. (`GHSA-vmhq-cqm9-6p7q`)(#43800) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Security/agent: reject public spawned-run lineage fields and keep workspace inheritance on the internal spawned-session path so external `agent` callers can no longer override the gateway workspace boundary. (`GHSA-2rqg-gjgv-84jm`)(#43801) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Security/session_status: enforce sandbox session-tree visibility and shared agent-to-agent access guards before reading or mutating target session state, so sandboxed subagents can no longer inspect parent session metadata or write parent model overrides via `session_status`. (`GHSA-wcxr-59v9-rxr8`)(#43754) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Security/agent tools: mark `nodes` as explicitly owner-only and document/test that `canvas` remains a shared trusted-operator surface unless a real boundary bypass exists.
- Security/exec approvals: fail closed for Ruby approval flows that use `-r`, `--require`, or `-I` so approval-backed commands no longer bind only the main script while extra local code-loading flags remain outside the reviewed file snapshot.
- Security/device pairing: cap issued and verified device-token scopes to each paired device's approved scope baseline so stale or overbroad tokens cannot exceed approved access. (`GHSA-2pwv-x786-56f8`)(#43686) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Docs/onboarding: align the legacy wizard reference and `openclaw onboard` command docs with the Ollama onboarding flow so all onboarding reference paths now document `--auth-choice ollama`, Cloud + Local mode, and non-interactive usage. (#43473) Thanks @BruceMacD.
- Models/secrets: enforce source-managed SecretRef markers in generated `models.json` so runtime-resolved provider secrets are not persisted when runtime projection is skipped. (#43759) Thanks @joshavant.
- Security/WebSocket preauth: shorten unauthenticated handshake retention and reject oversized pre-auth frames before application-layer parsing to reduce pre-pairing exposure on unsupported public deployments. (`GHSA-jv4g-m82p-2j93`)(#44089) (`GHSA-xwx2-ppv2-wx98`)(#44089) Thanks @ez-lbz and @vincentkoc.
- Security/proxy attachments: restore the shared media-store size cap for persisted browser proxy files so oversized payloads are rejected instead of overriding the intended 5 MB limit. (`GHSA-6rph-mmhp-h7h9`)(#43684) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Security/host env: block inherited `GIT_EXEC_PATH` from sanitized host exec environments so Git helper resolution cannot be steered by host environment state. (`GHSA-jf5v-pqgw-gm5m`)(#43685) Thanks @zpbrent and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Feishu webhook: require `encryptKey` alongside `verificationToken` in webhook mode so unsigned forged events are rejected instead of being processed with token-only configuration. (`GHSA-g353-mgv3-8pcj`)(#44087) Thanks @lintsinghua and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Feishu reactions: preserve looked-up group chat typing and fail closed on ambiguous reaction context so group authorization and mention gating cannot be bypassed through synthetic `p2p` reactions. (`GHSA-m69h-jm2f-2pv8`)(#44088) Thanks @zpbrent and @vincentkoc.
- Security/LINE webhook: require signatures for empty-event POST probes too so unsigned requests no longer confirm webhook reachability with a `200` response. (`GHSA-mhxh-9pjm-w7q5`)(#44090) Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Zalo webhook: rate limit invalid secret guesses before auth so weak webhook secrets cannot be brute-forced through unauthenticated churned requests without pre-auth `429` responses. (`GHSA-5m9r-p9g7-679c`)(#44173) Thanks @zpbrent and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Zalouser groups: require stable group IDs for allowlist auth by default and gate mutable group-name matching behind `channels.zalouser.dangerouslyAllowNameMatching`. Thanks @zpbrent.
- Security/Slack and Teams routing: require stable channel and team IDs for allowlist routing by default, with mutable name matching only via each channel's `dangerouslyAllowNameMatching` break-glass flag.
- Security/exec approvals: fail closed for ambiguous inline loader and shell-payload script execution, bind the real script after POSIX shell value-taking flags, and unwrap `pnpm`/`npm exec`/`npx` script runners before approval binding. (`GHSA-57jw-9722-6rf2`)(`GHSA-jvqh-rfmh-jh27`)(`GHSA-x7pp-23xv-mmr4`)(`GHSA-jc5j-vg4r-j5jx`)(#44247) Thanks @tdjackey and @vincentkoc.
- Doctor/gateway service audit: canonicalize service entrypoint paths before comparing them so symlink-vs-realpath installs no longer trigger false "entrypoint does not match the current install" repair prompts. (#43882) Thanks @ngutman.
- Doctor/gateway service audit: earlier groundwork for this fix landed in the superseded #28338 branch. Thanks @realriphub.
- Gateway/session stores: regenerate the Swift push-test protocol models and align Windows native session-store realpath handling so protocol checks and sync session discovery stop drifting on Windows. (#44266) thanks @jalehman.
- Context engine/session routing: forward optional `sessionKey` through context-engine lifecycle calls so plugins can see structured routing metadata during bootstrap, assembly, post-turn ingestion, and compaction. (#44157) thanks @jalehman.
- Agents/failover: classify z.ai `network_error` stop reasons as retryable timeouts so provider connectivity failures trigger fallback instead of surfacing raw unhandled-stop-reason errors. (#43884) Thanks @hougangdev.
- Memory/session sync: add mode-aware post-compaction session reindexing with `agents.defaults.compaction.postIndexSync` plus `agents.defaults.memorySearch.sync.sessions.postCompactionForce`, so compacted session memory can refresh immediately without forcing every deployment into synchronous reindexing. (#25561) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Telegram/model picker: make inline model button selections persist the chosen session model correctly, clear overrides when selecting the configured default, and include effective fallback models in `/models` button validation. (#40105) Thanks @avirweb.
- Telegram/native command sync: suppress expected `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` retry error noise, add a final fallback summary log, and document the difference between command-menu overflow and real Telegram network failures.
- Mattermost/reply media delivery: pass agent-scoped `mediaLocalRoots` through shared reply delivery so allowed local files upload correctly from button, slash-command, and model-picker replies. (#44021) Thanks @LyleLiu666.
- Plugins/env-scoped roots: fix plugin discovery/load caches and provenance tracking so same-process `HOME`/`OPENCLAW_HOME` changes no longer reuse stale plugin state or misreport `~/...` plugins as untracked. (#44046) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Gateway/session discovery: discover disk-only and retired ACP session stores under custom templated `session.store` roots so ACP reconciliation, session-id/session-label targeting, and run-id fallback keep working after restart. (#44176) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Models/OpenRouter native ids: canonicalize native OpenRouter model keys across config writes, runtime lookups, fallback management, and `models list --plain`, and migrate legacy duplicated `openrouter/openrouter/...` config entries forward on write.
- Gateway/hooks: bucket hook auth failures by forwarded client IP behind trusted proxies and warn when `hooks.allowedAgentIds` leaves hook routing unrestricted.
- Agents/compaction: skip the post-compaction `cache-ttl` marker write when a compaction completed in the same attempt, preventing the next turn from immediately triggering a second tiny compaction. (#28548) thanks @MoerAI.
- Native chat/macOS: add `/new`, `/reset`, and `/clear` reset triggers, keep shared main-session aliases aligned, and ignore stale model-selection completions so native chat state stays in sync across reset and fast model changes. (#10898) Thanks @Nachx639.
- Agents/compaction safeguard: route missing-model and missing-API-key cancellation warnings through the shared subsystem logger so they land in structured and file logs. (#9974) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Cron/doctor: stop flagging canonical `agentTurn` and `systemEvent` payload kinds as legacy cron storage, while still normalizing whitespace-padded and non-canonical variants. (#44012) Thanks @shuicici.
- ACP/client final-message delivery: preserve terminal assistant text snapshots before resolving `end_turn`, so ACP clients no longer drop the last visible reply when the gateway sends the final message body on the terminal chat event. (#17615) Thanks @pjeby.
- Telegram/Discord status reactions: show a temporary compacting reaction during auto-compaction pauses and restore thinking afterward so the bot no longer appears frozen while context is being compacted. (#35474) thanks @Cypherm.

## 2026.3.11

### Security

- Gateway/WebSocket: enforce browser origin validation for all browser-originated connections regardless of whether proxy headers are present, closing a cross-site WebSocket hijacking path in `trusted-proxy` mode that could grant untrusted origins `operator.admin` access. (GHSA-5wcw-8jjv-m286)

### Changes

- OpenRouter/models: add temporary Hunter Alpha and Healer Alpha entries to the built-in catalog so OpenRouter users can try the new free stealth models during their roughly one-week availability window. (#43642) Thanks @ping-Toven.
- iOS/Home canvas: add a bundled welcome screen with a live agent overview that refreshes on connect, reconnect, and foreground return, and move the compact connection pill off the top-left canvas overlay. (#42456) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Home canvas: replace floating controls with a docked toolbar, make the bundled home scaffold adapt to smaller phones, and open chat in the resolved main session instead of a synthetic `ios` session. (#42456) Thanks @ngutman.
- macOS/chat UI: add a chat model picker, persist explicit thinking-level selections across relaunch, and harden provider-aware session model sync for the shared chat composer. (#42314) Thanks @ImLukeF.
- Onboarding/Ollama: add first-class Ollama setup with Local or Cloud + Local modes, browser-based cloud sign-in, curated model suggestions, and cloud-model handling that skips unnecessary local pulls. (#41529) Thanks @BruceMacD.
- OpenCode/onboarding: add new OpenCode Go provider, treat Zen and Go as one OpenCode setup in the wizard/docs while keeping the runtime providers split, store one shared OpenCode key for both profiles, and stop overriding the built-in `opencode-go` catalog routing. (#42313) Thanks @ImLukeF and @vincentkoc.
- Memory: add opt-in multimodal image and audio indexing for `memorySearch.extraPaths` with Gemini `gemini-embedding-2-preview`, strict fallback gating, and scope-based reindexing. (#43460) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Memory/Gemini: add `gemini-embedding-2-preview` memory-search support with configurable output dimensions and automatic reindexing when the configured dimensions change. (#42501) Thanks @BillChirico and @gumadeiras.
- macOS/onboarding: detect when remote gateways need a shared auth token, explain where to find it on the gateway host, and clarify when a successful check used paired-device auth instead. (#43100) Thanks @ngutman.
- Discord/auto threads: add `autoArchiveDuration` channel config for auto-created threads so Discord thread archiving can stay at 1 hour, 1 day, 3 days, or 1 week instead of always using the 1-hour default. (#35065) Thanks @davidguttman.
- iOS/TestFlight: add a local beta release flow with Fastlane prepare/archive/upload support, canonical beta bundle IDs, and watch-app archive fixes. (#42991) Thanks @ngutman.
- ACP/sessions_spawn: add optional `resumeSessionId` for `runtime: "acp"` so spawned ACP sessions can resume an existing ACPX/Codex conversation instead of always starting fresh. (#41847) Thanks @pejmanjohn.
- Gateway/node pending work: add narrow in-memory pending-work queue primitives (`node.pending.enqueue` / `node.pending.drain`) and wake-helper reuse as a foundation for dormant-node work delivery. (#41409) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Git/runtime state: ignore the gateway-generated `.dev-state` file so local runtime state does not show up as untracked repo noise. (#41848) Thanks @smysle.
- Exec/child commands: mark child command environments with `OPENCLAW_CLI` so subprocesses can detect when they were launched from the OpenClaw CLI. (#41411) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- LLM Task/Lobster: add an optional `thinking` override so workflow calls can explicitly set embedded reasoning level with shared validation for invalid values and unsupported `xhigh` modes. (#15606) Thanks @xadenryan and @ImLukeF.
- Mattermost/reply threading: add `channels.mattermost.replyToMode` for channel and group messages so top-level posts can start thread-scoped sessions without the manual reply-then-thread workaround. (#29587) Thanks @teconomix.
- iOS/push relay: add relay-backed official-build push delivery with App Attest + receipt verification, gateway-bound send delegation, and config-based relay URL setup on the gateway. (#43369) Thanks @ngutman.

### Breaking

- Cron/doctor: tighten isolated cron delivery so cron jobs can no longer notify through ad hoc agent sends or fallback main-session summaries, and add `openclaw doctor --fix` migration for legacy cron storage and legacy notify/webhook delivery metadata. (#40998) Thanks @mbelinky.

### Fixes

- Windows/install: stop auto-installing `node-llama-cpp` during normal npm CLI installs so `openclaw@latest` no longer fails on Windows while building optional local-embedding dependencies.
- Windows/update: mirror the native installer environment during global npm updates, including portable Git fallback and Windows-safe npm shell settings, so `openclaw update` works again on native Windows installs.
- Gateway/status: expose `runtimeVersion` in gateway status output so install/update smoke tests can verify the running version before and after updates.
- Windows/onboarding: explain when non-interactive local onboarding is waiting for an already-running gateway, and surface native Scheduled Task admin requirements more clearly instead of failing with an opaque gateway timeout.
- Windows/gateway install: fall back from denied Scheduled Task creation to a per-user Startup-folder login item, so native `openclaw gateway install` and `--install-daemon` keep working without an elevated PowerShell shell.
- Agents/text sanitization: strip leaked model control tokens (`<|...|>` and full-width `<｜...｜>` variants) from user-facing assistant text, preventing GLM-5 and DeepSeek internal delimiters from reaching end users. (#42173) Thanks @imwyvern.
- iOS/gateway foreground recovery: reconnect immediately on foreground return after stale background sockets are torn down, so the app no longer stays disconnected until a later wake path happens. (#41384) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Control UI: keep dashboard auth tokens in session-scoped browser storage so same-tab refreshes preserve remote token auth without restoring long-lived localStorage token persistence, while scoping tokens to the selected gateway URL and fragment-only bootstrap flow. (#40892) thanks @velvet-shark.
- Gateway/macOS launchd restarts: keep the LaunchAgent registered during explicit restarts, hand off self-restarts through a detached launchd helper, and recover config/hot reload restart paths without unloading the service. Fixes #43311, #43406, #43035, and #43049.
- macOS/LaunchAgent install: tighten LaunchAgent directory and plist permissions during install so launchd bootstrap does not fail when the target home path or generated plist inherited group/world-writable modes.
- Discord/reply chunking: resolve the effective `maxLinesPerMessage` config across live reply paths and preserve `chunkMode` in the fast send path so long Discord replies no longer split unexpectedly at the default 17-line limit. (#40133) thanks @rbutera.
- Feishu/local image auto-convert: pass `mediaLocalRoots` through the `sendText` local-image shim so allowed local image paths upload as Feishu images again instead of falling back to raw path text. (#40623) Thanks @ayanesakura.
- Models/Kimi Coding: send `anthropic-messages` tools in native Anthropic format again so `kimi-coding` stops degrading tool calls into XML/plain-text pseudo invocations instead of real `tool_use` blocks. (#38669, #39907, #40552) Thanks @opriz.
- Telegram/outbound HTML sends: chunk long HTML-mode messages, preserve plain-text fallback and silent-delivery params across retries, and cut over to plain text when HTML chunk planning cannot safely preserve the full message. (#42240) thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/final preview delivery: split active preview lifecycle from cleanup retention so missing archived preview edits avoid duplicate fallback sends without clearing the live preview or blocking later in-place finalization. (#41662) thanks @hougangdev.
- Telegram/final preview delivery followup: keep ambiguous missing-`message_id` finals only when a preview was already visible, while first-preview/no-id cases still fall back so Telegram users do not lose the final reply. (#41932) thanks @hougangdev.
- Telegram/final preview cleanup follow-up: clear stale cleanup-retain state only for transient preview finals so archived-preview retains no longer leave a stale partial bubble beside a later fallback-sent final. (#41763) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/poll restarts: scope process-level polling restarts to real Telegram `getUpdates` failures so unrelated network errors, such as Slack DNS misses, no longer bounce Telegram polling. (#43799) Thanks @obviyus.
- Gateway/auth: allow one trusted device-token retry on shared-token mismatch with recovery hints to prevent reconnect churn during token drift. (#42507) Thanks @joshavant.
- Gateway/config errors: surface up to three validation issues in top-level `config.set`, `config.patch`, and `config.apply` error messages while preserving structured issue details. (#42664) Thanks @huntharo.
- Agents/Azure OpenAI Responses: include the `azure-openai` provider in the Responses API store override so Azure OpenAI multi-turn cron jobs and embedded agent runs no longer fail with HTTP 400 "store is set to false". (#42934, fixes #42800) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Agents/error rendering: ignore stale assistant `errorMessage` fields on successful turns so background/tool-side failures no longer prepend synthetic billing errors over valid replies. (#40616) Thanks @ingyukoh.
- Agents/billing recovery: probe single-provider billing cooldowns on the existing throttle so topping up credits can recover without a manual gateway restart. (#41422) thanks @altaywtf.
- Agents/fallback: treat HTTP 499 responses as transient in both raw-text and structured failover paths so Anthropic-style client-closed overload responses trigger model fallback reliably. (#41468) thanks @zeroasterisk.
- Agents/fallback: recognize Venice `402 Insufficient USD or Diem balance` billing errors so configured model fallbacks trigger instead of surfacing the raw provider error. (#43205) Thanks @Squabble9.
- Agents/fallback: recognize Poe `402 You've used up your points!` billing errors so configured model fallbacks trigger instead of surfacing the raw provider error. (#42278) Thanks @CryUshio.
- Agents/failover: treat Gemini `MALFORMED_RESPONSE` stop reasons as retryable timeouts so preview-model enum drift falls back cleanly instead of crashing the run, without also reclassifying malformed function-call errors. (#42292) Thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Agents/cooldowns: default cooldown windows with no recorded failure history to `unknown` instead of `rate_limit`, avoiding false API rate-limit warnings while preserving cooldown recovery probes. (#42911) Thanks @VibhorGautam.
- Auth/cooldowns: reset expired auth-profile cooldown error counters before computing the next backoff so stale on-disk counters do not re-escalate into long cooldown loops after expiry. (#41028) thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/memory flush: forward `memoryFlushWritePath` through `runEmbeddedPiAgent` so memory-triggered flush turns keep the append-only write guard without aborting before tool setup. Follows up on #38574. (#41761) Thanks @frankekn.
- Agents/context pruning: prune image-only tool results during soft-trim, align context-pruning coverage with the new tool-result contract, and extend historical image cleanup to the same screenshot-heavy session path. (#43045) Thanks @MoerAI.
- Sessions/reset model recompute: clear stale runtime model, context-token, and system-prompt metadata before session resets recompute the replacement session, so resets pick up current defaults and explicit overrides instead of reusing old runtime model state. (#41173) thanks @PonyX-lab.
- Channels/allowlists: remove stale matcher caching so same-array allowlist edits and wildcard replacements take effect immediately, with regression coverage for in-place mutation cases.
- Discord/Telegram outbound runtime config: thread runtime-resolved config through Discord and Telegram send paths so SecretRef-based credentials stay resolved during message delivery. (#42352) Thanks @joshavant.
- Tools/web search: treat Brave `llm-context` grounding snippets as plain strings so `web_search` no longer returns empty snippet arrays in LLM Context mode. (#41387) thanks @zheliu2.
- Tools/web search: recover OpenRouter Perplexity citation extraction from `message.annotations` when chat-completions responses omit top-level citations. (#40881) Thanks @laurieluo.
- CLI/skills JSON: strip ANSI and C1 control bytes from `skills list --json`, `skills info --json`, and `skills check --json` so machine-readable output stays valid for terminals and skill metadata with embedded control characters. Fixes #27530. Related #27557. Thanks @Jimmy-xuzimo and @vincentkoc.
- CLI/tables: default shared tables to ASCII borders on legacy Windows consoles while keeping Unicode borders on modern Windows terminals, so commands like `openclaw skills` stop rendering mojibake under GBK/936 consoles. Fixes #40853. Related #41015. Thanks @ApacheBin and @vincentkoc.
- CLI/memory teardown: close cached memory search/index managers in the one-shot CLI shutdown path so watcher-backed memory caches no longer keep completed CLI runs alive after output finishes. (#40389) thanks @Julbarth.
- Control UI/Sessions: restore single-column session table collapse on narrow viewport or container widths by moving the responsive table override next to the base grid rule and enabling inline-size container queries. (#12175) Thanks @benjipeng.
- Telegram/network env-proxy: apply configured transport policy to proxied HTTPS dispatchers as well as direct `NO_PROXY` bypasses, so resolver-scoped IPv4 fallback and network settings work consistently for env-proxied Telegram traffic. (#40740) Thanks @sircrumpet.
- Mattermost/Markdown formatting: preserve first-line indentation when stripping bot mentions so nested list items and indented code blocks keep their structure, and render Mattermost tables natively by default instead of fenced-code fallback. (#18655) thanks @echo931.
- Mattermost/plugin send actions: normalize direct `replyTo` fallback handling so threaded plugin sends trim blank IDs and reuse the correct reply target again. (#41176) Thanks @hnykda.
- MS Teams/allowlist resolution: use the General channel conversation ID as the resolved team key (with Graph GUID fallback) so Bot Framework runtime `channelData.team.id` matching works for team and team/channel allowlist entries. (#41838) Thanks @BradGroux.
- Signal/config schema: accept `channels.signal.accountUuid` in strict config validation so loop-protection configs no longer fail with an unrecognized-key error. (#35578) Thanks @ingyukoh.
- Telegram/config schema: accept `channels.telegram.actions.editMessage` and `createForumTopic` in strict config validation so existing Telegram action toggles no longer fail as unrecognized keys. (#35498) Thanks @ingyukoh.
- Telegram/docs: clarify that `channels.telegram.groups` allowlists chats while `groupAllowFrom` allowlists users inside those chats, and point invalid negative chat IDs at the right config key. (#42451) Thanks @altaywtf.
- Discord/config typing: expose channel-level `autoThread` on the canonical guild-channel config type so strict config loading matches the existing Discord schema and runtime behavior. (#35608) Thanks @ingyukoh.
- fix(models): guard optional model.input capability checks (#42096) thanks @andyliu
- Models/Alibaba Cloud Model Studio: wire `MODELSTUDIO_API_KEY` through shared env auth, implicit provider discovery, and shell-env fallback so onboarding works outside the wizard too. (#40634) Thanks @pomelo-nwu.
- Resolve web tool SecretRefs atomically at runtime. (#41599) Thanks @joshavant.
- Secret files: harden CLI and channel credential file reads against path-swap races by requiring direct regular files for `*File` secret inputs and rejecting symlink-backed secret files.
- Archive extraction: harden TAR and external `tar.bz2` installs against destination symlink and pre-existing child-symlink escapes by extracting into staging first and merging into the canonical destination with safe file opens.
- Secrets/SecretRef: reject exec SecretRef traversal ids across schema, runtime, and gateway. (#42370) Thanks @joshavant.
- Sandbox/fs bridge: pin staged writes to verified parent directories so temporary write files cannot materialize outside the allowed mount before atomic replace. Thanks @tdjackey.
- Gateway/auth: fail closed when local `gateway.auth.*` SecretRefs are configured but unavailable, instead of silently falling back to `gateway.remote.*` credentials in local mode. (#42672) Thanks @joshavant.
- Commands/config writes: enforce `configWrites` against both the originating account and the targeted account scope for `/config` and config-backed `/allowlist` edits, blocking sibling-account mutations while preserving gateway `operator.admin` flows. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/system.run: fail closed for approval-backed interpreter/runtime commands when OpenClaw cannot bind exactly one concrete local file operand, while extending best-effort direct-file binding to additional runtime forms. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gateway/session reset auth: split conversation `/new` and `/reset` handling away from the admin-only `sessions.reset` control-plane RPC so write-scoped gateway callers can no longer reach the privileged reset path through `agent`. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/plugin runtime: stop unauthenticated plugin HTTP routes from inheriting synthetic admin gateway scopes when they call `runtime.subagent.*`, so admin-only methods like `sessions.delete` stay blocked without gateway auth.
- Security/nodes: treat the `nodes` agent tool as owner-only fallback policy so non-owner senders cannot reach paired-node approval or invoke paths through the shared tool set.
- Sandbox/sessions_spawn: restore real workspace handoff for read-only sandboxed sessions so spawned subagents mount the configured workspace at `/agent` instead of inheriting the sandbox copy. Related #40582.
- Security/external content: treat whitespace-delimited `EXTERNAL UNTRUSTED CONTENT` boundary markers like underscore-delimited variants so prompt wrappers cannot bypass marker sanitization. (#35983) Thanks @urianpaul94.
- Telegram/exec approvals: reject `/approve` commands aimed at other bots, keep deterministic approval prompts visible when tool-result delivery fails, and stop resolved exact IDs from matching other pending approvals by prefix. (#37233) Thanks @huntharo.
- Subagents/authority: persist leaf vs orchestrator control scope at spawn time and route tool plus slash-command control through shared ownership checks, so leaf sessions cannot regain orchestration privileges after restore or flat-key lookups. Thanks @tdjackey.
- ACP/ACPX plugin: bump the bundled `acpx` pin to `0.1.16` so plugin-local installs and strict version checks match the latest published CLI. (#41975) Thanks @dutifulbob.
- ACP/sessions.patch: allow `spawnedBy` and `spawnDepth` lineage fields on ACP session keys so `sessions_spawn` with `runtime: "acp"` no longer fails during child-session setup. Fixes #40971. (#40995) thanks @xaeon2026.
- ACP/stop reason mapping: resolve gateway chat `state: "error"` completions as ACP `end_turn` instead of `refusal` so transient backend failures are not surfaced as deliberate refusals. (#41187) thanks @pejmanjohn.
- ACP/setSessionMode: propagate gateway `sessions.patch` failures back to ACP clients so rejected mode changes no longer return silent success. (#41185) thanks @pejmanjohn.
- ACP/bridge mode: reject unsupported per-session MCP server setup and propagate rejected session-mode changes so IDE clients see explicit bridge limitations instead of silent success. (#41424) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/session UX: replay stored user and assistant text on `loadSession`, expose Gateway-backed session controls and metadata, and emit approximate session usage updates so IDE clients restore context more faithfully. (#41425) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/tool streaming: enrich `tool_call` and `tool_call_update` events with best-effort text content and file-location hints so IDE clients can follow bridge tool activity more naturally. (#41442) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/runtime attachments: forward normalized inbound image attachments into ACP runtime turns so ACPX sessions can preserve image prompt content on the runtime path. (#41427) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/regressions: add gateway RPC coverage for ACP lineage patching, ACPX runtime coverage for image prompt serialization, and an operator smoke-test procedure for live ACP spawn verification. (#41456) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/follow-up hardening: make session restore and prompt completion degrade gracefully on transcript/update failures, enforce bounded tool-location traversal, and skip non-image ACPX turns the runtime cannot serialize. (#41464) Thanks @mbelinky.
- ACP/sessions_spawn: implicitly stream `mode="run"` ACP spawns to parent only for eligible subagent orchestrator sessions (heartbeat `target: "last"` with a usable session-local route), restoring parent progress relays without thread binding. (#42404) Thanks @davidguttman.
- ACP/main session aliases: canonicalize `main` before ACP session lookup so restarted ACP main sessions rehydrate instead of failing closed with `Session is not ACP-enabled: main`. (#43285, fixes #25692)
- Plugins/context-engine model auth: expose `runtime.modelAuth` and plugin-sdk auth helpers so plugins can resolve provider/model API keys through the normal auth pipeline. (#41090) thanks @xinhuagu.
- Hooks/plugin context parity followup: pass `trigger` and `channelId` through embedded `llm_input`, `agent_end`, and `llm_output` hook contexts so plugins receive the same agent metadata across hook phases. (#42362) Thanks @zhoulf1006.
- Plugins/global hook runner: harden singleton state handling so shared global hook runner reuse does not leak or corrupt runner state across executions. (#40184) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Context engine/tests: add bundled-registry regression coverage for cross-chunk resolution, plugin-sdk re-exports, and concurrent chunk registration. (#40460) thanks @dsantoreis.
- Agents/embedded runner: bound compaction retry waiting and drain embedded runs during SIGUSR1 restart so session lanes recover instead of staying blocked behind compaction. (#40324) thanks @cgdusek.
- Agents/embedded logs: add structured, sanitized lifecycle and failover observation events so overload and provider failures are easier to tail and filter. (#41336) thanks @altaywtf.
- Agents/embedded overload logs: include the failing model and provider in error-path console output, with lifecycle regression coverage for the rendered and sanitized `consoleMessage`. (#41236) thanks @jiarung.
- Agents/fallback observability: add structured, sanitized model-fallback decision and auth-profile failure-state events with correlated run IDs so cooldown probes and failover paths are easier to trace in logs. (#41337) thanks @altaywtf.
- Logging/probe observations: suppress structured embedded and model-fallback probe warnings on the console without hiding error or fatal output. (#41338) thanks @altaywtf.
- Agents/context-engine compaction: guard thrown engine-owned overflow compaction attempts and fire compaction hooks for `ownsCompaction` engines so overflow recovery no longer crashes and plugin subscribers still observe compact runs. (#41361) thanks @davidrudduck.
- Gateway/node pending drain followup: keep `hasMore` true when the deferred baseline status item still needs delivery, and avoid allocating empty pending-work state for drain-only nodes with no queued work. (#41429) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Protocol/Swift model sync: regenerate pending node work Swift bindings after the landed `node.pending.*` schema additions so generated protocol artifacts are consistent again. (#41477) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Cron/subagent followup: do not misclassify empty or `NO_REPLY` cron responses as interim acknowledgements that need a rerun, so deliberately silent cron jobs are no longer retried. (#41383) thanks @jackal092927.
- Cron/state errors: record `lastErrorReason` in cron job state and keep the gateway schema aligned with the full failover-reason set, including regression coverage for protocol conformance. (#14382) thanks @futuremind2026.
- Browser/Browserbase 429 handling: surface stable no-retry rate-limit guidance without buffering discarded HTTP 429 response bodies from remote browser services. (#40491) thanks @mvanhorn.
- CI/CodeQL Swift toolchain: select Xcode 26.1 before installing Swift build tools so the CodeQL Swift job uses Swift tools 6.2 on `macos-latest`. (#41787) thanks @BunsDev.
- Sandbox/subagents: pass the real configured workspace through `sessions_spawn` inheritance when a parent agent runs in a copied-workspace sandbox, so child `/agent` mounts point at the configured workspace instead of the parent sandbox copy. (#40757) Thanks @dsantoreis.
- Agents/fallback cooldown probing: cap cooldown-bypass probing to one attempt per provider per fallback run so multi-model same-provider cooldown chains can continue to cross-provider fallbacks instead of repeatedly stalling on duplicate cooldown probes. (#41711) Thanks @cgdusek.
- Telegram/direct delivery: bridge direct delivery sends to internal `message:sent` hooks so internal hook listeners observe successful Telegram deliveries. (#40185) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies: refresh workspace dependencies except the pinned Carbon package, and harden ACP session-config writes against non-string SDK values so newer ACP clients fail fast instead of tripping type/runtime mismatches.
- Telegram/polling restarts: clear bounded cleanup timeout handles after `runner.stop()` and `bot.stop()` settle so stall recovery no longer leaves stray 15-second timers behind on clean shutdown. (#43188) thanks @kyohwang.
- Gateway/config errors: surface up to three validation issues in top-level `config.set`, `config.patch`, and `config.apply` error messages while preserving structured issue details. (#42664) Thanks @huntharo.
- Hooks/plugin context parity followup: pass `trigger` and `channelId` through embedded `llm_input`, `agent_end`, and `llm_output` hook contexts so plugins receive the same agent metadata across hook phases. (#42362) Thanks @zhoulf1006.
- Status/context windows: normalize provider-qualified override cache keys so `/status` resolves the active provider's configured context window even when `models.providers` keys use mixed case or surrounding whitespace. (#36389) Thanks @haoruilee.
- ACP/main session aliases: canonicalize `main` before ACP session lookup so restarted ACP main sessions rehydrate instead of failing closed with `Session is not ACP-enabled: main`. (#43285, fixes #25692)
- Agents/embedded runner: recover canonical allowlisted tool names from malformed `toolCallId` and malformed non-blank tool-name variants before dispatch, while failing closed on ambiguous matches. (#34485) thanks @yuweuii.
- Agents/failover: classify ZenMux quota-refresh `402` responses as `rate_limit` so model fallback retries continue instead of stopping on a temporary subscription window. (#43917) thanks @bwjoke.
- Agents/failover: classify HTTP 422 malformed-request responses as `format` and recognize OpenRouter "requires more credits" billing errors so provider fallback triggers instead of surfacing raw errors. (#43823) thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Memory/QMD Windows: fail closed when `qmd.cmd` or `mcporter.cmd` wrappers cannot be resolved to a direct entrypoint, so memory search no longer falls back to shell execution on Windows.

## 2026.3.8

### Changes

- CLI/backup: add `openclaw backup create` and `openclaw backup verify` for local state archives, including `--only-config`, `--no-include-workspace`, manifest/payload validation, and backup guidance in destructive flows. (#40163) thanks @shichangs.
- macOS/onboarding: add a remote gateway token field for remote mode, preserve existing non-plaintext `gateway.remote.token` config values until explicitly replaced, and warn when the loaded token shape cannot be used directly from the macOS app. (#40187, supersedes #34614) Thanks @cgdusek.
- Talk mode: add top-level `talk.silenceTimeoutMs` config so Talk waits a configurable amount of silence before auto-sending the current transcript, while keeping each platform's existing default pause window when unset. (#39607) Thanks @danodoesdesign. Fixes #17147.
- TUI: infer the active agent from the current workspace when launched inside a configured agent workspace, while preserving explicit `agent:` session targets. (#39591) thanks @arceus77-7.
- Tools/Brave web search: add opt-in `tools.web.search.brave.mode: "llm-context"` so `web_search` can call Brave's LLM Context endpoint and return extracted grounding snippets with source metadata, plus config/docs/test coverage. (#33383) Thanks @thirumaleshp.
- CLI/install: include the short git commit hash in `openclaw --version` output when metadata is available, and keep installer version checks compatible with the decorated format. (#39712) thanks @sourman.
- CLI/backup: improve archive naming for date sorting, add config-only backup mode, and harden backup planning, publication, and verification edge cases. (#40163) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- ACP/Provenance: add optional ACP ingress provenance metadata and visible receipt injection (`openclaw acp --provenance off|meta|meta+receipt`) so OpenClaw agents can retain and report ACP-origin context with session trace IDs. (#40473) thanks @mbelinky.
- Tools/web search: alphabetize provider ordering across runtime selection, onboarding/configure pickers, and config metadata, so provider lists stay neutral and multi-key auto-detect now prefers Grok before Kimi. (#40259) thanks @kesku.
- Docs/Web search: restore $5/month free-credit details, replace defunct "Data for Search"/"Data for AI" plan names with current "Search" plan, and note legacy subscription validity in Brave setup docs. Follows up on #26860. (#40111) Thanks @remusao.
- Extensions/ACPX tests: move the shared runtime fixture helper from `src/runtime-internals/` to `src/test-utils/` so the test-only helper no longer looks like shipped runtime code.

### Fixes

- Update/macOS launchd restart: re-enable disabled LaunchAgent services before updater bootstrap so `openclaw update` can recover from a disabled gateway service instead of leaving the restart step stuck.
- macOS app/chat UI: route browser proxy through the local node browser service, preserve plain-text paste semantics, strip completed assistant trace/debug wrapper noise from transcripts, refresh permission state after returning from System Settings, and tolerate malformed cron rows in the macOS tab. (#39516) Thanks @Imhermes1.
- Android/Play distribution: remove self-update, background location, `screen.record`, and background mic capture from the Android app, narrow the foreground service to `dataSync` only, and clean up the legacy `location.enabledMode=always` preference migration. (#39660) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/DM routing: dedupe inbound Telegram DMs per agent instead of per session key so the same DM cannot trigger duplicate replies when both `agent:main:main` and `agent:main:telegram:direct:<id>` resolve for one agent. Fixes #40005. Supersedes #40116. (#40519) thanks @obviyus.
- Cron/Telegram announce delivery: route text-only announce jobs through the real outbound adapters after finalizing descendant output so plain Telegram targets no longer report `delivered: true` when no message actually reached Telegram. (#40575) thanks @obviyus.
- Matrix/DM routing: add safer fallback detection for broken `m.direct` homeservers, honor explicit room bindings over DM classification, and preserve room-bound agent selection for Matrix DM rooms. (#19736) Thanks @derbronko.
- Feishu/plugin onboarding: clear the short-lived plugin discovery cache before reloading the registry after installing a channel plugin, so onboarding no longer re-prompts to download Feishu immediately after a successful install. Fixes #39642. (#39752) Thanks @GazeKingNuWu.
- Plugins/channel onboarding: prefer bundled channel plugins over duplicate npm-installed copies during onboarding and release-channel sync, preventing bundled plugins from being shadowed by npm installs with the same plugin ID. (#40092)
- Config/runtime snapshots: keep secrets-runtime-resolved config and auth-profile snapshots intact after config writes so follow-up reads still see file-backed secret values while picking up the persisted config update. (#37313) thanks @bbblending.
- Gateway/Control UI: resolve bundled dashboard assets through symlinked global wrappers and auto-detected package roots, while keeping configured and custom roots on the strict hardlink boundary. (#40385) Thanks @LarytheLord.
- Browser/extension relay: add `browser.relayBindHost` so the Chrome relay can bind to an explicit non-loopback address for WSL2 and other cross-namespace setups, while preserving loopback-only defaults. (#39364) Thanks @mvanhorn.
- Browser/CDP: normalize loopback direct WebSocket CDP URLs back to HTTP(S) for `/json/*` tab operations so local `ws://` / `wss://` profiles can still list, focus, open, and close tabs after the new direct-WS support lands. (#31085) Thanks @shrey150.
- Browser/CDP: rewrite wildcard `ws://0.0.0.0` and `ws://[::]` debugger URLs from remote `/json/version` responses back to the external CDP host/port, fixing Browserless-style container endpoints. (#17760) Thanks @joeharouni.
- Browser/extension relay: wait briefly for a previously attached Chrome tab to reappear after transient relay drops before failing with `tab not found`, reducing noisy reconnect flakes. (#32461) Thanks @AaronWander.
- macOS/Tailscale gateway discovery: keep Tailscale Serve probing alive when other remote gateways are already discovered, prefer direct transport for resolved `.ts.net` and Tailscale Serve gateways, and set `TERM=dumb` for GUI-launched Tailscale CLI discovery. (#40167) thanks @ngutman.
- TUI/theme: detect light terminal backgrounds via `COLORFGBG` and pick a WCAG AA-compliant light palette, with `OPENCLAW_THEME=light|dark` override for terminals without auto-detection. (#38636) Thanks @ademczuk and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/openai-codex: normalize `gpt-5.4` fallback transport back to `openai-codex-responses` on `chatgpt.com/backend-api` when config drifts to the generic OpenAI responses endpoint. (#38736) Thanks @0xsline.
- Models/openai-codex GPT-5.4 forward-compat: use the GPT-5.4 1,050,000-token context window and 128,000 max tokens for `openai-codex/gpt-5.4` instead of inheriting stale legacy Codex limits in resolver fallbacks and model listing. (#37876) thanks @yuweuii.
- Tools/web search: restore Perplexity OpenRouter/Sonar compatibility for legacy `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `sk-or-...`, and explicit `perplexity.baseUrl` / `model` setups while keeping direct Perplexity keys on the native Search API path. (#39937) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/failover: detect Amazon Bedrock `Too many tokens per day` quota errors as rate limits across fallback, cron retry, and memory embeddings while keeping context-window `too many tokens per request` errors out of the rate-limit lane. (#39377) Thanks @gambletan.
- Mattermost replies: keep `root_id` pinned to the existing thread root when an agent replies inside a thread, while still using reply-target threading for top-level posts. (#27744) thanks @hnykda.
- Telegram/DM partial streaming: keep DM preview lanes on real message edits instead of native draft materialization so final replies no longer flash a second duplicate copy before collapsing back to one.
- macOS overlays: fix VoiceWake, Talk, and Notify overlay exclusivity crashes by removing shared `inout` visibility mutation from `OverlayPanelFactory.present`, and add a repeated Talk overlay smoke test. (#39275, #39321) Thanks @fellanH.
- macOS Talk Mode: set the speech recognition request `taskHint` to `.dictation` for mic capture, and add regression coverage for the request defaults. (#38445) Thanks @dmiv.
- macOS release packaging: default `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` to universal binaries for `BUILD_CONFIG=release`, and clarify that `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh` already produces the release zip + DMG. (#33891) Thanks @cgdusek.
- Hooks/session-memory: keep `/new` and `/reset` memory artifacts in the bound agent workspace and align saved reset session keys with that workspace when stale main-agent keys leak into the hook path. (#39875) thanks @rbutera.
- Sessions/model switch: clear stale cached `contextTokens` when a session changes models so status and runtime paths recompute against the active model window. (#38044) thanks @yuweuii.
- ACP/session history: persist transcripts for successful ACP child runs, preserve exact transcript text, record ACP spawned-session lineage, and keep spawn-time transcript-path persistence best-effort so history storage failures do not block execution. (#40137) thanks @mbelinky.
- Docs/browser: add a layered WSL2 + Windows remote Chrome CDP troubleshooting guide, including Control UI origin pitfalls and extension-relay bind-address guidance. (#39407) Thanks @Owlock.
- Context engine registry/bundled builds: share the registry state through a `globalThis` singleton so duplicated bundled module copies can resolve engines registered by each other at runtime, with regression coverage for duplicate-module imports. (#40115) thanks @jalehman.
- Podman/setup: fix `cannot chdir: Permission denied` in `run_as_user` when `setup-podman.sh` is invoked from a directory the target user cannot access, by wrapping user-switch calls in a subshell that cd's to `/tmp` with `/` fallback. (#39435) Thanks @langdon and @jlcbk.
- Podman/SELinux: auto-detect SELinux enforcing/permissive mode and add `:Z` relabel to bind mounts in `run-openclaw-podman.sh` and the Quadlet template, fixing `EACCES` on Fedora/RHEL hosts. Supports `OPENCLAW_BIND_MOUNT_OPTIONS` override. (#39449) Thanks @langdon and @githubbzxs.
- Agents/context-engine plugins: bootstrap runtime plugins once at embedded-run, compaction, and subagent boundaries so plugin-provided context engines and hooks load from the active workspace before runtime resolution. (#40232)
- Docs/Changelog: correct the contributor credit for the bundled Control UI global-install fix to @LarytheLord. (#40420) Thanks @velvet-shark.
- Telegram/media downloads: time out only stalled body reads so polling recovers from hung file downloads without aborting slow downloads that are still streaming data. (#40098) thanks @tysoncung.
- Docker/runtime image: prune dev dependencies, strip build-only dist metadata for smaller Docker images. (#40307) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Subagents/sandboxing: restrict leaf subagents to their own spawned runs and remove leaf `subagents` control access so sandboxed leaf workers can no longer steer sibling sessions. Thanks @tdjackey.
- Gateway/restart timeout recovery: exit non-zero when restart-triggered shutdown drains time out so launchd/systemd restart the gateway instead of treating the failed restart as a clean stop. Landed from contributor PR #40380 by @dsantoreis. Thanks @dsantoreis.
- Gateway/config restart guard: validate config before service start/restart and keep post-SIGUSR1 startup failures from crashing the gateway process, reducing invalid-config restart loops and macOS permission loss. Landed from contributor PR #38699 by @lml2468. Thanks @lml2468.
- Gateway/launchd respawn detection: treat `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` as a launchd supervision hint so macOS restarts exit cleanly under launchd instead of attempting detached self-respawn. Landed from contributor PR #20555 by @dimat. Thanks @dimat.
- Telegram/poll restart cleanup: abort the in-flight Telegram API fetch when shutdown or forced polling restarts stop a runner, preventing stale `getUpdates` long polls from colliding with the replacement runner. Landed from contributor PR #23950 by @Gkinthecodeland. Thanks @Gkinthecodeland.
- Cron/restart catch-up staggering: limit immediate missed-job replay on startup and reschedule the deferred remainder from the post-catchup clock so restart bursts do not starve the gateway or silently skip overdue recurring jobs. Landed from contributor PR #18925 by @rexlunae. Thanks @rexlunae.
- Cron/owner-only tools: pass trusted isolated cron runs into the embedded agent with owner context so `cron`/`gateway` tooling remains available after the owner-auth hardening narrowed direct-message ownership inference.
- Browser/SSRF: block private-network intermediate redirect hops in strict browser navigation flows and fail closed when remote tab-open paths cannot inspect redirect chains. Thanks @zpbrent.
- MS Teams/authz: keep `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` enforcing sender allowlists even when a team/channel route allowlist is configured, so route matches no longer widen group access to every sender in that route. Thanks @zpbrent.
- Security/Gateway: block `device.token.rotate` from minting operator scopes broader than the caller session already holds, closing the critical paired-device token privilege escalation reported as GHSA-4jpw-hj22-2xmc.
- Security/system.run: bind approved `bun` and `deno run` script operands to on-disk file snapshots so post-approval script rewrites are denied before execution.
- Skills/download installs: pin the validated per-skill tools root before writing downloaded archives, so rebinding the lexical tools path cannot redirect download writes outside the intended tools directory. Thanks @tdjackey.
- Control UI/Debug: replace the Manual RPC free-text method field with a sorted dropdown sourced from gateway-advertised methods, and stack the form vertically for narrower layouts. (#14967) thanks @rixau.
- Auth/profile resolution: log debug details when auto-discovered auth profiles fail during provider API-key resolution, so `--debug` output surfaces the real refresh/keychain/credential-store failure instead of only the generic missing-key message. (#41271) thanks @he-yufeng.
- ACP/cancel scoping: scope `chat.abort` and shared-session ACP event routing by `runId` so one session cannot cancel or consume another session's run when they share the same gateway session key. (#41331) Thanks @pejmanjohn.
- SecretRef/models: harden custom/provider secret persistence and reuse across models.json snapshots, merge behavior, runtime headers, and secret audits. (#42554) Thanks @joshavant.
- macOS/browser proxy: serialize non-GET browser proxy request bodies through `AnyCodable.foundationValue` so nested JSON bodies no longer crash the macOS app with `Invalid type in JSON write (__SwiftValue)`. (#43069) Thanks @Effet.
- CLI/skills tables: keep terminal table borders aligned for wide graphemes, use full reported terminal width, and switch a few ambiguous skill icons to Terminal-safe emoji so `openclaw skills` renders more consistently in Terminal.app and iTerm. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/Gemini: normalize returned Gemini embeddings across direct query, direct batch, and async batch paths so memory search uses consistent vector handling for Gemini too. (#43409) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/failover: recognize additional serialized network errno strings plus `EHOSTDOWN` and `EPIPE` structured codes so transient transport failures trigger timeout failover more reliably. (#42830) Thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Telegram/model picker: make inline model button selections persist the chosen session model correctly, clear overrides when selecting the configured default, and include effective fallback models in `/models` button validation. (#40105) Thanks @avirweb.
- Agents/embedded runner: carry provider-observed overflow token counts into compaction so overflow retries and diagnostics use the rejected live prompt size instead of only transcript estimates. (#40357) thanks @rabsef-bicrym.
- Agents/compaction transcript updates: emit a transcript-update event immediately after successful embedded compaction so downstream listeners observe the post-compact transcript without waiting for a later write. (#25558) thanks @rodrigouroz.

## 2026.3.7

### Changes

- Agents/context engine plugin interface: add `ContextEngine` plugin slot with full lifecycle hooks (`bootstrap`, `ingest`, `assemble`, `compact`, `afterTurn`, `prepareSubagentSpawn`, `onSubagentEnded`), slot-based registry with config-driven resolution, `LegacyContextEngine` wrapper preserving existing compaction behavior, scoped subagent runtime for plugin runtimes via `AsyncLocalStorage`, and `sessions.get` gateway method. Enables plugins like `lossless-claw` to provide alternative context management strategies without modifying core compaction logic. Zero behavior change when no context engine plugin is configured. (#22201) thanks @jalehman.
- ACP/persistent channel bindings: add durable Discord channel and Telegram topic binding storage, routing resolution, and CLI/docs support so ACP thread targets survive restarts and can be managed consistently. (#34873) Thanks @dutifulbob.
- Telegram/ACP topic bindings: accept Telegram Mac Unicode dash option prefixes in `/acp spawn`, support Telegram topic thread binding (`--thread here|auto`), route bound-topic follow-ups to ACP sessions, add actionable Telegram approval buttons with prefixed approval-id resolution, and pin successful bind confirmations in-topic. (#36683) Thanks @huntharo.
- Telegram/topic agent routing: support per-topic `agentId` overrides in forum groups and DM topics so topics can route to dedicated agents with isolated sessions. (#33647; based on #31513) Thanks @kesor and @Sid-Qin.
- Web UI/i18n: add Spanish (`es`) locale support in the Control UI, including locale detection, lazy loading, and language picker labels across supported locales. (#35038) Thanks @DaoPromociones.
- Onboarding/web search: add provider selection step and full provider list in configure wizard, with SecretRef ref-mode support during onboarding. (#34009) Thanks @kesku and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Tools/Web search: switch Perplexity provider to Search API with structured results plus new language/region/time filters. (#33822) Thanks @kesku.
- Gateway: add SecretRef support for gateway.auth.token with auth-mode guardrails. (#35094) Thanks @joshavant.
- Docker/Podman extension dependency baking: add `OPENCLAW_EXTENSIONS` so container builds can preinstall selected bundled extension npm dependencies into the image for faster and more reproducible startup in container deployments. (#32223) Thanks @sallyom.
- Plugins/before_prompt_build system-context fields: add `prependSystemContext` and `appendSystemContext` so static plugin guidance can be placed in system prompt space for provider caching and lower repeated prompt token cost. (#35177) thanks @maweibin.
- Plugins/hook policy: add `plugins.entries.<id>.hooks.allowPromptInjection`, validate unknown typed hook names at runtime, and preserve legacy `before_agent_start` model/provider overrides while stripping prompt-mutating fields when prompt injection is disabled. (#36567) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Hooks/Compaction lifecycle: emit `session:compact:before` and `session:compact:after` internal events plus plugin compaction callbacks with session/count metadata, so automations can react to compaction runs consistently. (#16788) thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/compaction post-context configurability: add `agents.defaults.compaction.postCompactionSections` so deployments can choose which `AGENTS.md` sections are re-injected after compaction, while preserving legacy fallback behavior when the documented default pair is configured in any order. (#34556) thanks @efe-arv.
- TTS/OpenAI-compatible endpoints: add `messages.tts.openai.baseUrl` config support with config-over-env precedence, endpoint-aware directive validation, and OpenAI TTS request routing to the resolved base URL. (#34321) thanks @RealKai42.
- Slack/DM typing feedback: add `channels.slack.typingReaction` so Socket Mode DMs can show reaction-based processing status even when Slack native assistant typing is unavailable. (#19816) Thanks @dalefrieswthat.
- Discord/allowBots mention gating: add `allowBots: "mentions"` to only accept bot-authored messages that mention the bot. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Agents/tool-result truncation: preserve important tail diagnostics by using head+tail truncation for oversized tool results while keeping configurable truncation options. (#20076) thanks @jlwestsr.
- Cron/job snapshot persistence: skip backup during normalization persistence in `ensureLoaded` so `jobs.json.bak` keeps the pre-edit snapshot for recovery, while preserving backup creation on explicit user-driven writes. (#35234) Thanks @0xsline.
- CLI: make read-only SecretRef status flows degrade safely (#37023) thanks @joshavant.
- Tools/Diffs guidance: restore a short system-prompt hint for enabled diffs while keeping the detailed instructions in the companion skill, so diffs usage guidance stays out of user-prompt space. (#36904) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Tools/Diffs guidance loading: move diffs usage guidance from unconditional prompt-hook injection to the plugin companion skill path, reducing unrelated-turn prompt noise while keeping diffs tool behavior unchanged. (#32630) thanks @sircrumpet.
- Docs/Web search: remove outdated Brave free-tier wording and replace prescriptive AI ToS guidance with neutral compliance language in Brave setup docs. (#26860) Thanks @HenryLoenwind.
- Config/Compaction safeguard tuning: expose `agents.defaults.compaction.recentTurnsPreserve` and quality-guard retry knobs through the validated config surface and embedded-runner wiring, with regression coverage for real config loading and schema metadata. (#25557) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- iOS/App Store Connect release prep: align iOS bundle identifiers under `ai.openclaw.client`, refresh Watch app icons, add Fastlane metadata/screenshot automation, and support Keychain-backed ASC auth for uploads. (#38936) Thanks @ngutman.
- Mattermost/model picker: add Telegram-style interactive provider/model browsing for `/oc_model` and `/oc_models`, fix picker callback updates, and emit a normal confirmation reply when a model is selected. (#38767) thanks @mukhtharcm.
- Docker/multi-stage build: restructure Dockerfile as a multi-stage build to produce a minimal runtime image without build tools, source code, or Bun; add `OPENCLAW_VARIANT=slim` build arg for a bookworm-slim variant. (#38479) Thanks @sallyom.
- Google/Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite: add first-class `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` support across model-id normalization, default aliases, media-understanding image lookups, Google Gemini CLI forward-compat fallback, and docs.
- Agents/compaction model override: allow `agents.defaults.compaction.model` to route compaction summarization through a different model than the main session, and document the override across config help/reference surfaces. (#38753) thanks @starbuck100.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Gateway auth now requires explicit `gateway.auth.mode` when both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured (including SecretRefs). Set `gateway.auth.mode` to `token` or `password` before upgrade to avoid startup/pairing/TUI failures. (#35094) Thanks @joshavant.

### Fixes

- Models/MiniMax: stop advertising removed `MiniMax-M2.5-Lightning` in built-in provider catalogs, onboarding metadata, and docs; keep the supported fast-tier model as `MiniMax-M2.5-highspeed`.
- Models/Vercel AI Gateway: synthesize the built-in `vercel-ai-gateway` provider from `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and auto-discover the live `/v1/models` catalog so `/models vercel-ai-gateway` exposes current refs including `openai/gpt-5.4`.
- Security/Config: fail closed when `loadConfig()` hits validation or read errors so invalid configs cannot silently fall back to permissive runtime defaults. (#9040) Thanks @joetomasone.
- Memory/Hybrid search: preserve negative FTS5 BM25 relevance ordering in `bm25RankToScore()` so stronger keyword matches rank above weaker ones instead of collapsing or reversing scores. (#33757) Thanks @lsdcc01.
- LINE/`requireMention` group gating: align inbound and reply-stage LINE group policy resolution across raw, `group:`, and `room:` keys (including account-scoped group config), preserve plugin-backed reply-stage fallback behavior, and add regression coverage for prefixed-only group/room config plus reply-stage policy resolution. (#35847) Thanks @kirisame-wang.
- Onboarding/local setup: default unset local `tools.profile` to `coding` instead of `messaging`, restoring file/runtime tools for fresh local installs while preserving explicit user-set profiles. (from #38241, overlap with #34958) Thanks @cgdusek.
- Gateway/Telegram stale-socket restart guard: only apply stale-socket restarts to channels that publish event-liveness timestamps, preventing Telegram providers from being misclassified as stale solely due to long uptime and avoiding restart/pairing storms after upgrade. (openclaw#38464)
- Onboarding/headless Linux daemon probe hardening: treat `systemctl --user is-enabled` probe failures as non-fatal during daemon install flow so onboarding no longer crashes on SSH/headless VPS environments before showing install guidance. (#37297) Thanks @acarbajal-web.
- Memory/QMD mcporter Windows spawn hardening: when `mcporter.cmd` launch fails with `spawn EINVAL`, retry via bare `mcporter` shell resolution so QMD recall can continue instead of falling back to builtin memory search. (#27402) Thanks @i0ivi0i.
- Tools/web_search Brave language-code validation: align `search_lang` handling with Brave-supported codes (including `zh-hans`, `zh-hant`, `en-gb`, and `pt-br`), map common alias inputs (`zh`, `ja`) to valid Brave values, and reject unsupported codes before upstream requests to prevent 422 failures. (#37260) Thanks @heyanming.
- Models/openai-completions streaming compatibility: force `compat.supportsUsageInStreaming=false` for non-native OpenAI-compatible endpoints during model normalization, preventing usage-only stream chunks from triggering `choices[0]` parser crashes in provider streams. (#8714) Thanks @nonanon1.
- Tools/xAI native web-search collision guard: drop OpenClaw `web_search` from tool registration when routing to xAI/Grok model providers (including OpenRouter `x-ai/*`) to avoid duplicate tool-name request failures against provider-native `web_search`. (#14749) Thanks @realsamrat.
- TUI/token copy-safety rendering: treat long credential-like mixed alphanumeric tokens (including quoted forms) as copy-sensitive in render sanitization so formatter hard-wrap guards no longer inject visible spaces into auth-style values before display. (#26710) Thanks @jasonthane.
- WhatsApp/self-chat response prefix fallback: stop forcing `"[openclaw]"` as the implicit outbound response prefix when no identity name or response prefix is configured, so blank/default prefix settings no longer inject branding text unexpectedly in self-chat flows. (#27962) Thanks @ecanmor.
- Memory/QMD search result decoding: accept `qmd search` hits that only include `file` URIs (for example `qmd://collection/path.md`) without `docid`, resolve them through managed collection roots, and keep multi-collection results keyed by file fallback so valid QMD hits no longer collapse to empty `memory_search` output. (#28181) Thanks @0x76696265.
- Memory/QMD collection-name conflict recovery: when `qmd collection add` fails because another collection already occupies the same `path + pattern`, detect the conflicting collection from `collection list`, remove it, and retry add so agent-scoped managed collections are created deterministically instead of being silently skipped; also add warning-only fallback when qmd metadata is unavailable to avoid destructive guesses. (#25496) Thanks @Ramsbaby.
- Slack/app_mention race dedupe: when `app_mention` dispatch wins while same-`ts` `message` prepare is still in-flight, suppress the later message dispatch so near-simultaneous Slack deliveries do not produce duplicate replies; keep single-retry behavior and add regression coverage for both dropped and successful message-prepare outcomes. (#37033) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Gateway/chat streaming tool-boundary text retention: merge assistant delta segments into per-run chat buffers so pre-tool text is preserved in live chat deltas/finals when providers emit post-tool assistant segments as non-prefix snapshots. (#36957) Thanks @Datyedyeguy.
- TUI/model indicator freshness: prevent stale session snapshots from overwriting freshly patched model selection (and reset per-session freshness when switching session keys) so `/model` updates reflect immediately instead of lagging by one or more commands. (#21255) Thanks @kowza.
- TUI/final-error rendering fallback: when a chat `final` event has no renderable assistant content but includes envelope `errorMessage`, render the formatted error text instead of collapsing to `"(no output)"`, preserving actionable failure context in-session. (#14687) Thanks @Mquarmoc.
- TUI/session-key alias event matching: treat chat events whose session keys are canonical aliases (for example `agent:<id>:main` vs `main`) as the same session while preserving cross-agent isolation, so assistant replies no longer disappear or surface in another terminal window due to strict key-form mismatch. (#33937) Thanks @yjh1412.
- OpenAI Codex OAuth/login parity: keep `openclaw models auth login --provider openai-codex` on the built-in path even without provider plugins, preserve Pi-generated authorize URLs without local scope rewriting, and stop validating successful Codex sign-ins against the public OpenAI Responses API after callback. (#37558; follow-up to #36660 and #24720) Thanks @driesvints, @Skippy-Gunboat, and @obviyus.
- Agents/config schema lookup: add `gateway` tool action `config.schema.lookup` so agents can inspect one config path at a time before edits without loading the full schema into prompt context. (#37266) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Onboarding/API key input hardening: strip non-Latin1 Unicode artifacts from normalized secret input (while preserving Latin-1 content and internal spaces) so malformed copied API keys cannot trigger HTTP header `ByteString` construction crashes; adds regression coverage for shared normalization and MiniMax auth header usage. (#24496) Thanks @fa6maalassaf.
- Kimi Coding/Anthropic tools compatibility: normalize `anthropic-messages` tool payloads to OpenAI-style `tools[].function` + compatible `tool_choice` when targeting Kimi Coding endpoints, restoring tool-call workflows that regressed after v2026.3.2. (#37038) Thanks @mochimochimochi-hub.
- Heartbeat/workspace-path guardrails: append explicit workspace `HEARTBEAT.md` path guidance (and `docs/heartbeat.md` avoidance) to heartbeat prompts so heartbeat runs target workspace checklists reliably across packaged install layouts. (#37037) Thanks @stofancy.
- Node/system.run approvals: bind approval prompts to the exact executed argv text and show shell payload only as a secondary preview, closing basename-spoofed wrapper approval mismatches. Thanks @tdjackey.
- Subagents/kill-complete announce race: when a late `subagent-complete` lifecycle event arrives after an earlier kill marker, clear stale kill suppression/cleanup flags and re-run announce cleanup so finished runs no longer get silently swallowed. (#37024) Thanks @cmfinlan.
- Agents/tool-result cleanup timeout hardening: on embedded runner teardown idle timeouts, clear pending tool-call state without persisting synthetic `missing tool result` entries, preventing timeout cleanups from poisoning follow-up turns; adds regression coverage for timeout clear-vs-flush behavior. (#37081) Thanks @Coyote-Den.
- Agents/openai-completions stream timeout hardening: ensure runtime undici global dispatchers use extended streaming body/header timeouts (including env-proxy dispatcher mode) before embedded runs, reducing forced mid-stream `terminated` failures on long generations; adds regression coverage for dispatcher selection and idempotent reconfiguration. (#9708) Thanks @scottchguard.
- Agents/fallback cooldown probe execution: thread explicit rate-limit cooldown probe intent from model fallback into embedded runner auth-profile selection so same-provider fallback attempts can actually run when all profiles are cooldowned for `rate_limit` (instead of failing pre-run as `No available auth profile`), while preserving default cooldown skip behavior and adding regression tests at both fallback and runner layers. (#13623) Thanks @asfura.
- Cron/OpenAI Codex OAuth refresh hardening: when `openai-codex` token refresh fails specifically on account-id extraction, reuse the cached access token instead of failing the run immediately, with regression coverage to keep non-Codex and unrelated refresh failures unchanged. (#36604) Thanks @laulopezreal.
- TUI/session isolation for `/new`: make `/new` allocate a unique `tui-<uuid>` session key instead of resetting the shared agent session, so multiple TUI clients on the same agent stop receiving each other’s replies; also sanitize `/new` and `/reset` failure text before rendering in-terminal. Landed from contributor PR #39238 by @widingmarcus-cyber. Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Synology Chat/rate-limit env parsing: honor `SYNOLOGY_RATE_LIMIT=0` as an explicit value while still falling back to the default limit for malformed env values instead of partially parsing them. Landed from contributor PR #39197 by @scoootscooob. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Voice-call/OpenAI Realtime STT config defaults: honor explicit `vadThreshold: 0` and `silenceDurationMs: 0` instead of silently replacing them with defaults. Landed from contributor PR #39196 by @scoootscooob. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Voice-call/OpenAI TTS speed config: honor explicit `speed: 0` instead of silently replacing it with the default speed. Landed from contributor PR #39318 by @ql-wade. Thanks @ql-wade.
- launchd/runtime PID parsing: reject `pid <= 0` from `launchctl print` so the daemon state parser no longer treats kernel/non-running sentinel values as real process IDs. Landed from contributor PR #39281 by @mvanhorn. Thanks @mvanhorn.
- Cron/file permission hardening: enforce owner-only (`0600`) cron store/backup/run-log files and harden cron store + run-log directories to `0700`, including pre-existing directories from older installs. (#36078) Thanks @aerelune.
- Gateway/remote WS break-glass hostname support: honor `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1` for `ws://` hostname URLs (not only private IP literals) across onboarding validation and runtime gateway connection checks, while still rejecting public IP literals and non-unicast IPv6 endpoints. (#36930) Thanks @manju-rn.
- Routing/binding lookup scalability: pre-index route bindings by channel/account and avoid full binding-list rescans on channel-account cache rollover, preventing multi-second `resolveAgentRoute` stalls in large binding configurations. (#36915) Thanks @songchenghao.
- Browser/session cleanup: track browser tabs opened by session-scoped browser tool runs and close tracked tabs during `sessions.reset`/`sessions.delete` runtime cleanup, preventing orphaned tabs and unbounded browser memory growth after session teardown. (#36666) Thanks @Harnoor6693.
- Plugin/hook install rollback hardening: stage installs under the canonical install base, validate and run dependency installs before publish, and restore updates by rename instead of deleting the target path, reducing partial-replace and symlink-rebind risk during install failures.
- Slack/local file upload allowlist parity: propagate `mediaLocalRoots` through the Slack send action pipeline so workspace-rooted attachments pass `assertLocalMediaAllowed` checks while non-allowlisted paths remain blocked. (synthesis: #36656; overlap considered from #36516, #36496, #36493, #36484, #32648, #30888) Thanks @2233admin.
- Agents/compaction safeguard pre-check: skip embedded compaction before entering the Pi SDK when a session has no real conversation messages, avoiding unnecessary LLM API calls on idle sessions. (#36451) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Config/schema cache key stability: build merged schema cache keys with incremental hashing to avoid large single-string serialization and prevent `RangeError: Invalid string length` on high-cardinality plugin/channel metadata. (#36603) Thanks @powermaster888.
- iMessage/cron completion announces: strip leaked inline reply tags (for example `[[reply_to:6100]]`) from user-visible completion text so announcement deliveries do not expose threading metadata. (#24600) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Cron/manual run enqueue flow: queue `cron.run` requests behind the cron execution lane, return immediate `{ ok: true, enqueued: true, runId }` acknowledgements, preserve `{ ok: true, ran: false, reason }` skip responses for already-running and not-due jobs, and document the asynchronous completion flow. (#40204)
- Control UI/iMessage duplicate reply routing: keep internal webchat turns on dispatcher delivery (instead of origin-channel reroute) so Control UI chats do not duplicate replies into iMessage, while preserving webchat-provider relayed routing for external surfaces. Fixes #33483. Thanks @alicexmolt.
- Sessions/daily reset transcript archival: archive prior transcript files during stale-session scheduled/daily resets by capturing the previous session entry before rollover, preventing orphaned transcript files on disk. (#35493) Thanks @byungsker.
- Feishu/group slash command detection: normalize group mention wrappers before command-authorization probing so mention-prefixed commands (for example `@Bot/model` and `@Bot /reset`) are recognized as gateway commands instead of being forwarded to the agent. (#35994) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Control UI/auth token separation: keep the shared gateway token in browser auth validation while reserving cached device tokens for signed device payloads, preventing false `device token mismatch` disconnects after restart/rotation. Landed from contributor PR #37382 by @FradSer. Thanks @FradSer.
- Gateway/browser auth reconnect hardening: stop counting missing token/password submissions as auth rate-limit failures, and stop auto-reconnecting Control UI clients on non-recoverable auth errors so misconfigured browser tabs no longer lock out healthy sessions. Landed from contributor PR #38725 by @ademczuk. Thanks @ademczuk.
- Gateway/service token drift repair: stop persisting shared auth tokens into installed gateway service units, flag stale embedded service tokens for reinstall, and treat tokenless service env as canonical so token rotation/reboot flows stay aligned with config/env resolution. Landed from contributor PR #28428 by @l0cka. Thanks @l0cka.
- Control UI/agents-page selection: keep the edited agent selected after saving agent config changes and reloading the agents list, so `/agents` no longer snaps back to the default agent. Landed from contributor PR #39301 by @MumuTW. Thanks @MumuTW.
- Gateway/auth follow-up hardening: preserve systemd `EnvironmentFile=` precedence/source provenance in daemon audits and doctor repairs, block shared-password override flows from piggybacking cached device tokens, and fail closed when config-first gateway SecretRefs cannot resolve. Follow-up to #39241.
- Agents/context pruning: guard assistant thinking/text char estimation against malformed blocks (missing `thinking`/`text` strings or null entries) so pruning no longer crashes with malformed provider content. (openclaw#35146) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Agents/transcript policy: set `preserveSignatures` to Anthropic-only handling in `resolveTranscriptPolicy` so Anthropic thinking signatures are preserved while non-Anthropic providers remain unchanged. (#32813) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Agents/schema cleaning: detect Venice + Grok model IDs as xAI-proxied targets so unsupported JSON Schema keywords are stripped before requests, preventing Venice/Grok `Invalid arguments` failures. (openclaw#35355) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Skills/native command deduplication: centralize skill command dedupe by canonical `skillName` in `listSkillCommandsForAgents` so duplicate suffixed variants (for example `_2`) are no longer surfaced across interfaces outside Discord. (#27521) thanks @shivama205.
- Agents/xAI tool-call argument decoding: decode HTML-entity encoded xAI/Grok tool-call argument values (`&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, numeric entities) before tool execution so commands with shell operators and quotes no longer fail with parse errors. (#35276) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Linux/WSL2 daemon install hardening: add regression coverage for WSL environment detection, WSL-specific systemd guidance, and `systemctl --user is-enabled` failure paths so WSL2/headless onboarding keeps treating bus-unavailable probes as non-fatal while preserving real permission errors. Related: #36495. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Linux/systemd status and degraded-session handling: treat degraded-but-reachable `systemctl --user status` results as available, preserve early errors for truly unavailable user-bus cases, and report externally managed running services as running instead of `not installed`. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/thinking-tag promotion hardening: guard `promoteThinkingTagsToBlocks` against malformed assistant content entries (`null`/`undefined`) before `block.type` reads so malformed provider payloads no longer crash session processing while preserving pass-through behavior. (#35143) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Gateway/Control UI version reporting: align runtime and browser client version metadata to avoid `dev` placeholders, wait for bootstrap version before first UI websocket connect, and only forward bootstrap `serverVersion` to same-origin gateway targets to prevent cross-target version leakage. (from #35230, #30928, #33928) Thanks @Sid-Qin, @joelnishanth, and @MoerAI.
- Control UI/markdown parser crash fallback: catch `marked.parse()` failures and fall back to escaped plain-text `<pre>` rendering so malformed recursive markdown no longer crashes Control UI session rendering on load. (#36445) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Control UI/markdown fallback regression coverage: add explicit regression assertions for parser-error fallback behavior so malformed markdown no longer risks reintroducing hard-crash rendering paths in future markdown/parser upgrades. (#36445) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Web UI/config form: treat `additionalProperties: true` object schemas as editable map entries instead of unsupported fields so Accounts-style maps stay editable in form mode. (#35380, supersedes #32072) Thanks @stakeswky and @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Feishu/streaming card delivery synthesis: unify snapshot and delta streaming merge semantics, apply overlap-aware final merge, suppress duplicate final text delivery (including text+media final packets), prefer topic-thread `message.reply` routing when a reply target exists, and tune card print cadence to avoid duplicate incremental rendering. (from #33245, #32896, #33840) Thanks @rexl2018, @kcinzgg, and @aerelune.
- Feishu/group mention detection: carry startup-probed bot display names through monitor dispatch so `requireMention` checks compare against current bot identity instead of stale config names, fixing missed `@bot` handling in groups while preserving multi-bot false-positive guards. (#36317, #34271) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Security/dependency audit: patch transitive Hono vulnerabilities by pinning `hono` to `4.12.5` and `@hono/node-server` to `1.19.10` in production resolution paths. Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Security/dependency audit: bump `tar` to `7.5.10` (from `7.5.9`) to address the high-severity hardlink path traversal advisory (`GHSA-qffp-2rhf-9h96`). Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Cron/announce delivery robustness: bypass pending-descendant announce guards for cron completion sends, ensure named-agent announce routes have outbound session entries, and fall back to direct delivery only when an announce send was actually attempted and failed. (from #35185, #32443, #34987) Thanks @Sid-Qin, @scoootscooob, and @bmendonca3.
- Cron/announce best-effort fallback: run direct outbound fallback after attempted announce failures even when delivery is configured as best-effort, so Telegram cron sends are not left as attempted-but-undelivered after `cron announce delivery failed` warnings.
- Auto-reply/system events: restore runtime system events to the message timeline (`System:` lines), preserve think-hint parsing with prepended events, and carry events into deferred followup/collect/steer-backlog prompts to keep cache behavior stable without dropping queued metadata. (#34794) Thanks @anisoptera.
- Security/audit account handling: avoid prototype-chain account IDs in audit validation by using own-property checks for `accounts`. (#34982) Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Cron/restart catch-up semantics: replay interrupted recurring jobs and missed immediate cron slots on startup without replaying interrupted one-shot jobs, with guarded missed-slot probing to avoid malformed-schedule startup aborts and duplicate-trigger drift after restart. (from #34466, #34896, #34625, #33206) Thanks @dunamismax, @dsantoreis, @Octane0411, and @Sid-Qin.
- Venice/provider onboarding hardening: align per-model Venice completion-token limits with discovery metadata, clamp untrusted discovery values to safe bounds, sync the static Venice fallback catalog with current live model metadata, and disable tool wiring for Venice models that do not support function calling so default Venice setups no longer fail with `max_completion_tokens` or unsupported-tools 400s. Fixes #38168. Thanks @Sid-Qin, @powermaster888 and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/session usage tracking: preserve accumulated usage metadata on embedded Pi runner error exits so failed turns still update session `totalTokens` from real usage instead of stale prior values. (#34275) thanks @RealKai42.
- Slack/reaction thread context routing: carry Slack native DM channel IDs through inbound context and threading tool resolution so reaction targets resolve consistently for DM `To=user:*` sessions (including `toolContext.currentChannelId` fallback behavior). (from #34831; overlaps #34440, #34502, #34483, #32754) Thanks @dunamismax.
- Subagents/announce completion scoping: scope nested direct-child completion aggregation to the current requester run window, harden frozen completion capture for deterministic descendant synthesis, and route completion announce delivery through parent-agent announce turns with provenance-aware internal events. (#35080) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Nodes/system.run approval hardening: use explicit argv-mutation signaling when regenerating prepared `rawCommand`, and cover the `system.run.prepare -> system.run` handoff so direct PATH-based `nodes.run` commands no longer fail with `rawCommand does not match command`. (#33137) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Models/custom provider headers: propagate `models.providers.<name>.headers` across inline, fallback, and registry-found model resolution so header-authenticated proxies consistently receive configured request headers. (#27490) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Ollama/remote provider auth fallback: synthesize a local runtime auth key for explicitly configured `models.providers.ollama` entries that omit `apiKey`, so remote Ollama endpoints run without requiring manual dummy-key setup while preserving env/profile/config key precedence and missing-config failures. (#11283) Thanks @cpreecs.
- Ollama/custom provider headers: forward resolved model headers into native Ollama stream requests so header-authenticated Ollama proxies receive configured request headers. (#24337) thanks @echoVic.
- Ollama/compaction and summarization: register custom `api: "ollama"` handling for compaction, branch-style internal summarization, and TTS text summarization on current `main`, so native Ollama models no longer fail with `No API provider registered for api: ollama` outside the main run loop. Thanks @JaviLib.
- Daemon/systemd install robustness: treat `systemctl --user is-enabled` exit-code-4 `not-found` responses as not-enabled by combining stderr/stdout detail parsing, so Ubuntu fresh installs no longer fail with `systemctl is-enabled unavailable`. (#33634) Thanks @Yuandiaodiaodiao.
- Slack/system-event session routing: resolve reaction/member/pin/interaction system-event session keys through channel/account bindings (with sender-aware DM routing) so inbound Slack events target the correct agent session in multi-account setups instead of defaulting to `agent:main`. (#34045) Thanks @paulomcg, @daht-mad and @vincentkoc.
- Slack/native streaming markdown conversion: stop pre-normalizing text passed to Slack native `markdown_text` in streaming start/append/stop paths to prevent Markdown style corruption from double conversion. (#34931)
- Gateway/HTTP tools invoke media compatibility: preserve raw media payload access for direct `/tools/invoke` clients by allowing media `nodes` invoke commands only in HTTP tool context, while keeping agent-context media invoke blocking to prevent base64 prompt bloat. (#34365) Thanks @obviyus.
- Security/archive ZIP hardening: extract ZIP entries via same-directory temp files plus atomic rename, then re-open and reject post-rename hardlink alias races outside the destination root.
- Agents/Nodes media outputs: add dedicated `photos_latest` action handling, block media-returning `nodes invoke` commands, keep metadata-only `camera.list` invoke allowed, and normalize empty `photos_latest` results to a consistent response shape to prevent base64 context bloat. (#34332) Thanks @obviyus.
- TUI/session-key canonicalization: normalize `openclaw tui --session` values to lowercase so uppercase session names no longer drop real-time streaming updates due to gateway/TUI key mismatches. (#33866, #34013) thanks @lynnzc.
- iMessage/echo loop hardening: strip leaked assistant-internal scaffolding from outbound iMessage replies, drop reflected assistant-content messages before they re-enter inbound processing, extend echo-cache text retention for delayed reflections, and suppress repeated loop traffic before it amplifies into queue overflow. (#33295) Thanks @joelnishanth.
- Skills/workspace boundary hardening: reject workspace and extra-dir skill roots or `SKILL.md` files whose realpath escapes the configured source root, and skip syncing those escaped skills into sandbox workspaces.
- Outbound/send config threading: pass resolved SecretRef config through outbound adapters and helper send paths so send flows do not reload unresolved runtime config. (#33987) Thanks @joshavant.
- gateway: harden shared auth resolution across systemd, discord, and node host (#39241) Thanks @joshavant.
- Secrets/models.json persistence hardening: keep SecretRef-managed api keys + headers from persisting in generated models.json, expand audit/apply coverage, and harden marker handling/serialization. (#38955) Thanks @joshavant.
- Sessions/subagent attachments: remove `attachments[].content.maxLength` from `sessions_spawn` schema to avoid llama.cpp GBNF repetition overflow, and preflight UTF-8 byte size before buffer allocation while keeping runtime file-size enforcement unchanged. (#33648) Thanks @anisoptera.
- Runtime/tool-state stability: recover from dangling Anthropic `tool_use` after compaction, serialize long-running Discord handler runs without blocking new inbound events, and prevent stale busy snapshots from suppressing stuck-channel recovery. (from #33630, #33583) Thanks @kevinWangSheng and @theotarr.
- ACP/Discord startup hardening: clean up stuck ACP worker children on gateway restart, unbind stale ACP thread bindings during Discord startup reconciliation, and add per-thread listener watchdog timeouts so wedged turns cannot block later messages. (#33699) Thanks @dutifulbob.
- Extensions/media local-root propagation: consistently forward `mediaLocalRoots` through extension `sendMedia` adapters (Google Chat, Slack, iMessage, Signal, WhatsApp), preserving non-local media behavior while restoring local attachment resolution from configured roots. Synthesis of #33581, #33545, #33540, #33536, #33528. Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Gateway/plugin HTTP auth hardening: require gateway auth when any overlapping matched route needs it, block mixed-auth fallthrough at dispatch, and reject mixed-auth exact/prefix route overlaps during plugin registration.
- Feishu/video media send contract: keep mp4-like outbound payloads on `msg_type: "media"` (including reply and reply-in-thread paths) so videos render as media instead of degrading to file-link behavior, while preserving existing non-video file subtype handling. (from #33720, #33808, #33678) Thanks @polooooo, @dingjianrui, and @kevinWangSheng.
- Gateway/security default response headers: add `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` to baseline gateway HTTP security headers for all responses. (#30186) thanks @habakan.
- Plugins/startup loading: lazily initialize plugin runtime, split startup-critical plugin SDK imports into `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` and `openclaw/plugin-sdk/telegram`, and preserve `api.runtime` reflection semantics for plugin compatibility. (#28620) thanks @hmemcpy.
- Plugins/startup performance: reduce bursty plugin discovery/manifest overhead with short in-process caches, skip importing bundled memory plugins that are disabled by slot selection, and speed legacy root `openclaw/plugin-sdk` compatibility via runtime root-alias routing while preserving backward compatibility. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Build/lazy runtime boundaries: replace ineffective dynamic import sites with dedicated lazy runtime boundaries across Slack slash handling, Telegram audit, CLI send deps, memory fallback, and outbound delivery paths while preserving behavior. (#33690) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Gateway/password CLI hardening: add `openclaw gateway run --password-file`, warn when inline `--password` is used because it can leak via process listings, and document env/file-backed password input as the preferred startup path. Fixes #27948. Thanks @vibewrk and @vincentkoc.
- Config/heartbeat legacy-path handling: auto-migrate top-level `heartbeat` into `agents.defaults.heartbeat` (with merge semantics that preserve explicit defaults), and keep startup failures on non-migratable legacy entries in the detailed invalid-config path instead of generic migration-failed errors. (#32706) thanks @xiwan.
- Plugins/SDK subpath parity: expand plugin SDK subpaths across bundled channels/extensions (Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp, LINE, and bundled companion plugins), with build/export/type/runtime wiring so scoped imports resolve consistently in source and dist while preserving compatibility. (#33737) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Google/Gemini Flash model selection: switch built-in `gemini-flash` defaults and docs/examples from the nonexistent `google/gemini-3.1-flash-preview` ID to the working `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`, while normalizing legacy OpenClaw config that still uses the old Flash 3.1 alias.
- Plugins/bundled scoped-import migration: migrate bundled plugins from monolithic `openclaw/plugin-sdk` imports to scoped subpaths (or `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core`) across registration and startup-sensitive runtime files, add CI/release guardrails to prevent regressions, and keep root `openclaw/plugin-sdk` support for external/community plugins. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Routing/session duplicate suppression synthesis: align shared session delivery-context inheritance, channel-paired route-field merges, and reply-surface target matching so dmScope=main turns avoid cross-surface duplicate replies while thread-aware forwarding keeps intended routing semantics. (from #33629, #26889, #17337, #33250) Thanks @Yuandiaodiaodiao, @kevinwildenradt, @Glucksberg, and @bmendonca3.
- Routing/legacy session route inheritance: preserve external route metadata inheritance for legacy channel session keys (`agent:<agent>:<channel>:<peer>` and `...:thread:<id>`) so `chat.send` does not incorrectly fall back to webchat when valid delivery context exists. Follow-up to #33786.
- Routing/legacy route guard tightening: require legacy session-key channel hints to match the saved delivery channel before inheriting external routing metadata, preventing custom namespaced keys like `agent:<agent>:work:<ticket>` from inheriting stale non-webchat routes.
- Gateway/internal client routing continuity: prevent webchat/TUI/UI turns from inheriting stale external reply routes by requiring explicit `deliver: true` for external delivery, keeping main-session external inheritance scoped to non-Webchat/UI clients, and honoring configured `session.mainKey` when identifying main-session continuity. (from #35321, #34635, #35356) Thanks @alexyyyander and @Octane0411.
- Security/auth labels: remove token and API-key snippets from user-facing auth status labels so `/status` and `/models` do not expose credential fragments. (#33262) thanks @cu1ch3n.
- Models/MiniMax portal vision routing: add `MiniMax-VL-01` to the `minimax-portal` provider, route portal image understanding through the MiniMax VLM endpoint, and align media auto-selection plus Telegram sticker description with the shared portal image provider path. (#33953) Thanks @tars90percent.
- Auth/credential semantics: align profile eligibility + probe diagnostics with SecretRef/expiry rules and harden browser download atomic writes. (#33733) thanks @joshavant.
- Security/audit denyCommands guidance: suggest likely exact node command IDs for unknown `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries so ineffective denylist entries are easier to correct. (#29713) thanks @liquidhorizon88-bot.
- Agents/overload failover handling: classify overloaded provider failures separately from rate limits/status timeouts, add short overload backoff before retry/failover, record overloaded prompt/assistant failures as transient auth-profile cooldowns (with probeable same-provider fallback) instead of treating them like persistent auth/billing failures, and keep one-shot cron retry classification aligned so overloaded fallback summaries still count as transient retries.
- Docs/security hardening guidance: document Docker `DOCKER-USER` + UFW policy and add cross-linking from Docker install docs for VPS/public-host setups. (#27613) thanks @dorukardahan.
- Docs/security threat-model links: replace relative `.md` links with Mintlify-compatible root-relative routes in security docs to prevent broken internal navigation. (#27698) thanks @clawdoo.
- Plugins/Update integrity drift: avoid false integrity drift prompts when updating npm-installed plugins from unpinned specs, while keeping drift checks for exact pinned versions. (#37179) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- iOS/Voice timing safety: guard system speech start/finish callbacks to the active utterance to avoid misattributed start events during rapid stop/restart cycles. (#33304) thanks @mbelinky; original implementation direction by @ngutman.
- Gateway/chat.send command scopes: require `operator.admin` for persistent `/config set|unset` writes routed through gateway chat clients while keeping `/config show` available to normal write-scoped operator clients, preserving messaging-channel config command behavior without widening RPC write scope into admin config mutation. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- iOS/Talk incremental speech pacing: allow long punctuation-free assistant chunks to start speaking at safe whitespace boundaries so voice responses begin sooner instead of waiting for terminal punctuation. (#33305) thanks @mbelinky; original implementation by @ngutman.
- iOS/Watch reply reliability: make watch session activation waiters robust under concurrent requests so status/send calls no longer hang intermittently, and align delegate callbacks with Swift 6 actor safety. (#33306) thanks @mbelinky; original implementation by @Rocuts.
- Docs/tool-loop detection config keys: align `docs/tools/loop-detection.md` examples and field names with the current `tools.loopDetection` schema to prevent copy-paste validation failures from outdated keys. (#33182) Thanks @Mylszd.
- Gateway/session agent discovery: include disk-scanned agent IDs in `listConfiguredAgentIds` even when `agents.list` is configured, so disk-only/ACP agent sessions remain visible in gateway session aggregation and listings. (#32831) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Discord/inbound debouncer: skip bot-own MESSAGE_CREATE events before they reach the debounce queue to avoid self-triggered slowdowns in busy servers. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/Agent-scoped media roots: pass `mediaLocalRoots` through Discord monitor reply delivery (message + component interaction paths) so local media attachments honor per-agent workspace roots instead of falling back to default global roots. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/slash command handling: intercept text-based slash commands in channels, register plugin commands as native, and send fallback acknowledgments for empty slash runs so interactions do not hang. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/thread session lifecycle: reset thread-scoped sessions when a thread is archived so reopening a thread starts fresh without deleting transcript history. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/presence defaults: send an online presence update on ready when no custom presence is configured so bots no longer appear offline by default. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/typing cleanup: stop typing indicators after silent/NO_REPLY runs by marking the run complete before dispatch idle cleanup. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- ACP/sandbox spawn parity: block `/acp spawn` from sandboxed requester sessions with the same host-runtime guard already enforced for `sessions_spawn({ runtime: "acp" })`, preserving non-sandbox ACP flows while closing the command-path policy gap. Thanks @patte.
- Discord/config SecretRef typing: align Discord account token config typing with SecretInput so SecretRef tokens typecheck. (#32490) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Discord/voice messages: request upload slots with JSON fetch calls so voice message uploads no longer fail with content-type errors. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/voice decoder fallback: drop the native Opus dependency and use opusscript for voice decoding to avoid native-opus installs. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/auto presence health signal: add runtime availability-driven presence updates plus connected-state reporting to improve health monitoring and operator visibility. (#33277) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- HEIC image inputs: accept HEIC/HEIF `input_image` sources in Gateway HTTP APIs, normalize them to JPEG before provider delivery, and document the expanded default MIME allowlist. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/HEIC input follow-up: keep non-HEIC `input_image` MIME handling unchanged, make HEIC tests hermetic, and enforce chat-completions `maxTotalImageBytes` against post-normalization image payload size. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/draft-stream boundary stability: materialize DM draft previews at assistant-message/tool boundaries, serialize lane-boundary callbacks before final delivery, and scope preview cleanup to the active preview so multi-step Telegram streams no longer lose, overwrite, or leave stale preview bubbles. (#33842) Thanks @ngutman.
- Telegram/DM draft finalization reliability: require verified final-text draft emission before treating preview finalization as delivered, and fall back to normal payload send when final draft delivery is not confirmed (preventing missing final responses and preserving media/button delivery). (#32118) Thanks @OpenCils.
- Telegram/DM draft final delivery: materialize text-only `sendMessageDraft` previews into one permanent final message and skip duplicate final payload sends, while preserving fallback behavior when materialization fails. (#34318) Thanks @Brotherinlaw-13.
- Telegram/DM draft duplicate display: clear stale DM draft previews after materializing the real final message, including threadless fallback when DM topic lookup fails, so partial streaming no longer briefly shows duplicate replies. (#36746) Thanks @joelnishanth.
- Telegram/draft preview boundary + silent-token reliability: stabilize answer-lane message boundaries across late-partial/message-start races, preserve/reset finalized preview state at the correct boundaries, and suppress `NO_REPLY` lead-fragment leaks without broad heartbeat-prefix false positives. (#33169) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/native commands `commands.allowFrom` precedence: make native Telegram commands honor `commands.allowFrom` as the command-specific authorization source, including group chats, instead of falling back to channel sender allowlists. (#28216) Thanks @toolsbybuddy and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/`groupAllowFrom` sender-ID validation: restore sender-only runtime validation so negative chat/group IDs remain invalid entries instead of appearing accepted while still being unable to authorize group access. (#37134) Thanks @qiuyuemartin-max and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/native group command auth: authorize native commands in groups and forum topics against `groupAllowFrom` and per-group/topic sender overrides, while keeping auth rejection replies in the originating topic thread. (#39267) Thanks @edwluo.
- Telegram/named-account DMs: restore non-default-account DM routing when a named Telegram account falls back to the default agent by keeping groups fail-closed but deriving a per-account session key for DMs, including identity-link canonicalization and regression coverage for account isolation. (from #32426; fixes #32351) Thanks @chengzhichao-xydt.
- Discord/audit wildcard warnings: ignore "\*" wildcard keys when counting unresolved guild channels so doctor/status no longer warns on allow-all configs. (#33125) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/channel resolution: default bare numeric recipients to channels, harden allowlist numeric ID handling with safe fallbacks, and avoid inbound WS heartbeat stalls. (#33142) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/chunk delivery reliability: preserve chunk ordering when using a REST client and retry chunk sends on 429/5xx using account retry settings. (#33226) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/mention handling: add id-based mention formatting + cached rewrites, resolve inbound mentions to display names, and add optional ignoreOtherMentions gating (excluding @everyone/@here). (#33224) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/media SSRF allowlist: allow Discord CDN hostnames (including wildcard domains) in inbound media SSRF policy to prevent proxy/VPN fake-ip blocks. (#33275) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Telegram/device pairing notifications: auto-arm one-shot notify on `/pair qr`, auto-ping on new pairing requests, and add manual fallback via `/pair approve latest` if the ping does not arrive. (#33299) thanks @mbelinky.
- Exec heartbeat routing: scope exec-triggered heartbeat wakes to agent session keys so unrelated agents are no longer awakened by exec events, while preserving legacy unscoped behavior for non-canonical session keys. (#32724) thanks @altaywtf
- macOS/Tailscale remote gateway discovery: add a Tailscale Serve fallback peer probe path (`wss://<peer>.ts.net`) when Bonjour and wide-area DNS-SD discovery return no gateways, and refresh both discovery paths from macOS onboarding. (#32860) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Gateway keychain hardening: move gateway metadata and TLS fingerprints to device keychain storage with safer migration behavior and rollback-safe writes to reduce credential loss risk during upgrades. (#33029) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Concurrency stability: replace risky shared-state access in camera and gateway connection paths with lock-protected access patterns to reduce crash risk under load. (#33241) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Security guardrails: limit production API-key sourcing to app config and make deep-link confirmation prompts safer by coalescing queued requests instead of silently dropping them. (#33031) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/TTS playback fallback: keep voice playback resilient by switching from PCM to MP3 when provider format support is unavailable, while avoiding sticky fallback on generic local playback errors. (#33032) thanks @mbelinky.
- Plugin outbound/text-only adapter compatibility: allow direct-delivery channel plugins that only implement `sendText` (without `sendMedia`) to remain outbound-capable, gracefully fall back to text delivery for media payloads when `sendMedia` is absent, and fail explicitly for media-only payloads with no text fallback. (#32788) thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Telegram/multi-account default routing clarity: warn only for ambiguous (2+) account setups without an explicit default, add `openclaw doctor` warnings for missing/invalid multi-account defaults across channels, and document explicit-default guidance for channel routing and Telegram config. (#32544) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Telegram/plugin outbound hook parity: run `message_sending` + `message_sent` in Telegram reply delivery, include reply-path hook metadata (`mediaUrls`, `threadId`), and report `message_sent.success=false` when hooks blank text and no outbound message is delivered. (#32649) Thanks @KimGLee.
- CLI/Coding-agent reliability: switch default `claude-cli` non-interactive args to `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, auto-normalize legacy `--dangerously-skip-permissions` backend overrides to the modern permission-mode form, align coding-agent + live-test docs with the non-PTY Claude path, and emit session system-event heartbeat notices when CLI watchdog no-output timeouts terminate runs. (#28610, #31149, #34055). Thanks @niceysam, @cryptomaltese and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/OpenAI chat completions: parse active-turn `image_url` content parts (including parameterized data URIs and guarded URL sources), forward them as multimodal `images`, accept image-only user turns, enforce per-request image-part/byte budgets, default URL-based image fetches to disabled unless explicitly enabled by config, and redact image base64 data in cache-trace/provider payload diagnostics. (#17685) Thanks @vincentkoc
- ACP/ACPX session bootstrap: retry with `sessions new` when `sessions ensure` returns no session identifiers so ACP spawns avoid `NO_SESSION`/`ACP_TURN_FAILED` failures on affected agents. (#28786, #31338, #34055). Thanks @Sid-Qin and @vincentkoc.
- ACP/sessions_spawn parent stream visibility: add `streamTo: "parent"` for `runtime: "acp"` to forward initial child-run progress/no-output/completion updates back into the requester session as system events (instead of direct child delivery), and emit a tail-able session-scoped relay log (`<sessionId>.acp-stream.jsonl`, returned as `streamLogPath` when available), improving orchestrator visibility for blocked or long-running harness turns. (#34310, #29909; reopened from #34055). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/bootstrap truncation warning handling: unify bootstrap budget/truncation analysis across embedded + CLI runtime, `/context`, and `openclaw doctor`; add `agents.defaults.bootstrapPromptTruncationWarning` (`off|once|always`, default `once`) and persist warning-signature metadata so truncation warnings are consistent and deduped across turns. (#32769) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/Skills runtime loading: propagate run config into embedded attempt and compaction skill-entry loading so explicitly enabled bundled companion skills are discovered consistently when skill snapshots do not already provide resolved entries. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/Session startup date grounding: substitute `YYYY-MM-DD` placeholders in startup/post-compaction AGENTS context and append runtime current-time lines for `/new` and `/reset` prompts so daily-memory references resolve correctly. (#32381) Thanks @chengzhichao-xydt.
- Agents/Compaction template heading alignment: update AGENTS template section names to `Session Startup`/`Red Lines` and keep legacy `Every Session`/`Safety` fallback extraction so post-compaction context remains intact across template versions. (#25098) thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Compaction continuity: expand staged-summary merge instructions to preserve active task status, batch progress, latest user request, and follow-up commitments so compaction handoffs retain in-flight work context. (#8903) thanks @joetomasone.
- Agents/Compaction safeguard structure hardening: require exact fallback summary headings, sanitize untrusted compaction instruction text before prompt embedding, and keep structured sections when preserving all turns. (#25555) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/status self version reporting: make Gateway self version in `openclaw status` prefer runtime `VERSION` (while preserving explicit `OPENCLAW_VERSION` override), preventing stale post-upgrade app version output. (#32655) thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Memory/QMD index isolation: set `QMD_CONFIG_DIR` alongside `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` so QMD config state stays per-agent despite upstream XDG handling bugs, preventing cross-agent collection indexing and excess disk/CPU usage. (#27028) thanks @HenryLoenwind.
- Memory/QMD collection safety: stop destructive collection rebinds when QMD `collection list` only reports names without path metadata, preventing `memory search` from dropping existing collections if re-add fails. (#36870) Thanks @Adnannnnnnna.
- Memory/QMD duplicate-document recovery: detect `UNIQUE constraint failed: documents.collection, documents.path` update failures, rebuild managed collections once, and retry update so periodic QMD syncs recover instead of failing every run; includes regression coverage to avoid over-matching unrelated unique constraints. (#27649) Thanks @MiscMich.
- Memory/local embedding initialization hardening: add regression coverage for transient initialization retry and mixed `embedQuery` + `embedBatch` concurrent startup to lock single-flight initialization behavior. (#15639) thanks @SubtleSpark.
- CLI/Coding-agent reliability: switch default `claude-cli` non-interactive args to `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, auto-normalize legacy `--dangerously-skip-permissions` backend overrides to the modern permission-mode form, align coding-agent + live-test docs with the non-PTY Claude path, and emit session system-event heartbeat notices when CLI watchdog no-output timeouts terminate runs. Related to #28261. Landed from contributor PRs #28610 and #31149. Thanks @niceysam, @cryptomaltese and @vincentkoc.
- ACP/ACPX session bootstrap: retry with `sessions new` when `sessions ensure` returns no session identifiers so ACP spawns avoid `NO_SESSION`/`ACP_TURN_FAILED` failures on affected agents. Related to #28786. Landed from contributor PR #31338. Thanks @Sid-Qin and @vincentkoc.
- LINE/auth boundary hardening synthesis: enforce strict LINE webhook authn/z boundary semantics across pairing-store account scoping, DM/group allowlist separation, fail-closed webhook auth/runtime behavior, and replay/duplication controls (including in-flight replay reservation and post-success dedupe marking). (from #26701, #26683, #25978, #17593, #16619, #31990, #26047, #30584, #18777) Thanks @bmendonca3, @davidahmann, @harshang03, @haosenwang1018, @liuxiaopai-ai, @coygeek, and @Takhoffman.
- LINE/media download synthesis: fix file-media download handling and M4A audio classification across overlapping LINE regressions. (from #26386, #27761, #27787, #29509, #29755, #29776, #29785, #32240) Thanks @kevinWangSheng, @loiie45e, @carrotRakko, @Sid-Qin, @codeafridi, and @bmendonca3.
- LINE/context and routing synthesis: fix group/room peer routing and command-authorization context propagation, and keep processing later events in mixed-success webhook batches. (from #21955, #24475, #27035, #28286) Thanks @lailoo, @mcaxtr, @jervyclaw, @Glucksberg, and @Takhoffman.
- LINE/status/config/webhook synthesis: fix status false positives from snapshot/config state and accept LINE webhook HEAD probes for compatibility. (from #10487, #25726, #27537, #27908, #31387) Thanks @BlueBirdBack, @stakeswky, @loiie45e, @puritysb, and @mcaxtr.
- LINE cleanup/test follow-ups: fold cleanup/test learnings into the synthesis review path while keeping runtime changes focused on regression fixes. (from #17630, #17289) Thanks @Clawborn and @davidahmann.
- Mattermost/interactive buttons: add interactive button send/callback support with directory-based channel/user target resolution, and harden callbacks via account-scoped HMAC verification plus sender-scoped DM routing. (#19957) thanks @tonydehnke.
- Feishu/groupPolicy legacy alias compatibility: treat legacy `groupPolicy: "allowall"` as `open` in both schema parsing and runtime policy checks so intended open-group configs no longer silently drop group messages when `groupAllowFrom` is empty. (from #36358) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Mattermost/plugin SDK import policy: replace remaining monolithic `openclaw/plugin-sdk` imports in Mattermost mention-gating paths/tests with scoped subpaths (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat` and `openclaw/plugin-sdk/mattermost`) so `pnpm check` passes `lint:plugins:no-monolithic-plugin-sdk-entry-imports` on baseline. (#36480) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Telegram/polls: add Telegram poll action support to channel action discovery and tool/CLI poll flows, with multi-account discoverability gated to accounts that can actually execute polls (`sendMessage` + `poll`). (#36547) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/failover cooldown classification: stop treating generic `cooling down` text as provider `rate_limit` so healthy models no longer show false global cooldown/rate-limit warnings while explicit `model_cooldown` markers still trigger failover. (#32972) thanks @stakeswky.
- Agents/failover service-unavailable handling: stop treating bare proxy/CDN `service unavailable` errors as provider overload while keeping them retryable via the timeout/failover path, so transient outages no longer show false rate-limit warnings or block fallback. (#36646) thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Plugins/HTTP route migration diagnostics: rewrite legacy `api.registerHttpHandler(...)` loader failures into actionable migration guidance so doctor/plugin diagnostics point operators to `api.registerHttpRoute(...)` or `registerPluginHttpRoute(...)`. (#36794) Thanks @vincentkoc
- Doctor/Heartbeat upgrade diagnostics: warn when heartbeat delivery is configured with an implicit `directPolicy` so upgrades pin direct/DM behavior explicitly instead of relying on the current default. (#36789) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/current-time UTC anchor: append a machine-readable UTC suffix alongside local `Current time:` lines in shared cron-style prompt contexts so agents can compare UTC-stamped workspace timestamps without doing timezone math. (#32423) thanks @jriff.
- Ollama/local model handling: preserve explicit lower `contextWindow` / `maxTokens` overrides during merge refresh, and keep native Ollama streamed replies from surfacing fallback `thinking` / `reasoning` text once real content starts streaming. (#39292) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- TUI/webchat command-owner scope alignment: treat internal-channel gateway sessions with `operator.admin` as owner-authorized in command auth, restoring cron/gateway/connector tool access for affected TUI/webchat sessions while keeping external channels on identity-based owner checks. (from #35666, #35673, #35704) Thanks @Naylenv, @Octane0411, and @Sid-Qin.
- Discord/inbound timeout isolation: separate inbound worker timeout tracking from listener timeout budgets so queued Discord replies are no longer dropped when listener watchdog windows expire mid-run. (#36602) Thanks @dutifulbob.
- Memory/doctor SecretRef handling: treat SecretRef-backed memory-search API keys as configured, and fail embedding setup with explicit unresolved-secret errors instead of crashing. (#36835) Thanks @joshavant.
- Memory/flush default prompt: ban timestamped variant filenames during default memory flush runs so durable notes stay in the canonical daily `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` file. (#34951) thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/reply delivery timing: flush embedded Pi block replies before waiting on compaction retries so already-generated assistant replies reach channels before compaction wait completes. (#35489) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Agents/gateway config guidance: stop exposing `config.schema` through the agent `gateway` tool, remove prompt/docs guidance that told agents to call it, and keep agents on `config.get` plus `config.patch`/`config.apply` for config changes. (#7382) thanks @kakuteki.
- Provider/KiloCode: Keep duplicate models after malformed discovery rows, and strip legacy `reasoning_effort` when proxy reasoning injection is skipped. (#32352) Thanks @pandemicsyn and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/failover: classify periodic provider limit exhaustion text (for example `Weekly/Monthly Limit Exhausted`) as `rate_limit` while keeping explicit `402 Payment Required` variants in billing, so failover continues without misclassifying billing-wrapped quota errors. (#33813) thanks @zhouhe-xydt.
- Mattermost/interactive button callbacks: allow external callback base URLs and stop requiring loopback-origin requests so button clicks work when Mattermost reaches the gateway over Tailscale, LAN, or a reverse proxy. (#37543) thanks @mukhtharcm.
- Gateway/chat.send route inheritance: keep explicit external delivery for channel-scoped sessions while preventing shared-main and other channel-agnostic webchat sessions from inheriting stale external routes, so Control UI replies stay on webchat without breaking selected channel-target sessions. (#34669) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Discord media upload caps: make outbound uploads honor channel `mediaMaxMb` config, raise Telegram's default media cap to 100MB, and remove MIME fallback limits that kept some Telegram uploads at 16MB. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Skills/nano-banana-pro resolution override: respect explicit `--resolution` values during image editing and only auto-detect output size from input images when the flag is omitted. (#36880) Thanks @shuofengzhang and @vincentkoc.
- Skills/openai-image-gen CLI validation: validate `--background` and `--style` inputs early, normalize supported values, and warn when those flags are ignored for incompatible models. (#36762) Thanks @shuofengzhang and @vincentkoc.
- Skills/openai-image-gen output formats: validate `--output-format` values early, normalize aliases like `jpg -> jpeg`, and warn when the flag is ignored for incompatible models. (#36648) Thanks @shuofengzhang and @vincentkoc.
- ACP/skill env isolation: strip skill-injected API keys from ACP harness child-process environments so tools like Codex CLI keep their own auth flow instead of inheriting billed provider keys from active skills. (#36316) Thanks @taw0002 and @vincentkoc.
- WhatsApp media upload caps: make outbound media sends and auto-replies honor `channels.whatsapp.mediaMaxMb` with per-account overrides so inbound and outbound limits use the same channel config. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Windows/Plugin install: when OpenClaw runs on Windows via Bun and `npm-cli.js` is not colocated with the runtime binary, fall back to `npm.cmd`/`npx.cmd` through the existing `cmd.exe` wrapper so `openclaw plugins install` no longer fails with `spawn EINVAL`. (#38056) Thanks @0xlin2023.
- Telegram/send retry classification: retry grammY `Network request ... failed after N attempts` envelopes in send flows without reclassifying plain `Network request ... failed!` wrappers as transient, restoring the intended retry path while keeping broad send-context message matching tight. (#38056) Thanks @0xlin2023.
- Gateway/probes: keep `/health`, `/healthz`, `/ready`, and `/readyz` reachable when the Control UI is mounted at `/`, preserve plugin-owned route precedence on those paths, and make `/ready` and `/readyz` report channel-backed readiness with startup grace plus `503` on disconnected managed channels, while `/health` and `/healthz` stay shallow liveness probes. (#18446) Thanks @vibecodooor, @mahsumaktas, and @vincentkoc.
- Feishu/media downloads: drop invalid timeout fields from SDK method calls now that client-level `httpTimeoutMs` applies to requests. (#38267) Thanks @ant1eicher and @thewilloftheshadow.
- PI embedded runner/Feishu docs: propagate sender identity into embedded attempts so Feishu doc auto-grant restores requester access for embedded-runner executions. (#32915) thanks @cszhouwei.
- Agents/usage normalization: normalize missing or partial assistant usage snapshots before compaction accounting so `openclaw agent --json` no longer crashes when provider payloads omit `totalTokens` or related usage fields. (#34977) thanks @sp-hk2ldn.
- Venice/default model refresh: switch the built-in Venice default to `kimi-k2-5`, update onboarding aliasing, and refresh Venice provider docs/recommendations to match the current private and anonymized catalog. (from #12964) Fixes #20156. Thanks @sabrinaaquino and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/skill API write pacing: add a global prompt guardrail that treats skill-driven external API writes as rate-limited by default, so runners prefer batched writes, avoid tight request loops, and respect `429`/`Retry-After`. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Google Chat/multi-account webhook auth fallback: when `channels.googlechat.accounts.default` carries shared webhook audience/path settings (for example after config normalization), inherit those defaults for named accounts while preserving top-level and per-account overrides, so inbound webhook verification no longer fails silently for named accounts missing duplicated audience fields. Fixes #38369.
- Models/tool probing: raise the tool-capability probe budget from 32 to 256 tokens so reasoning models that spend tokens on thinking before returning a required tool call are less likely to be misclassified as not supporting tools. (#7521) Thanks @jakobdylanc.
- Gateway/transient network classification: treat wrapped `...: fetch failed` transport messages as transient while avoiding broad matches like `Web fetch failed (404): ...`, preventing Discord reconnect wrappers from crashing the gateway without suppressing non-network tool failures. (#38530) Thanks @xinhuagu.
- ACP/console silent reply suppression: filter ACP `NO_REPLY` lead fragments and silent-only finals before `openclaw agent` logging/delivery so console-backed ACP sessions no longer leak `NO`/`NO_REPLY` placeholders. (#38436) Thanks @ql-wade.
- Feishu/reply delivery reliability: disable block streaming in Feishu reply options so plain-text auto-render replies are no longer silently dropped before final delivery. (#38258) Thanks @xinhuagu.
- Agents/reply MEDIA delivery: normalize local assistant `MEDIA:` paths before block/final delivery, keep media dedupe aligned with message-tool sends, and contain malformed media normalization failures so generated files send reliably instead of falling back to empty responses. (#38572) Thanks @obviyus.
- Sessions/bootstrap cache rollover invalidation: clear cached workspace bootstrap snapshots whenever an existing `sessionKey` rolls to a new `sessionId` across auto-reply, command, and isolated cron session resolvers, so `AGENTS.md`/`MEMORY.md`/`USER.md` updates are reloaded after daily, idle, or forced session resets instead of staying stale until gateway restart. (#38494) Thanks @LivingInDrm.
- Gateway/Telegram polling health monitor: skip stale-socket restarts for Telegram long-polling channels and thread channel identity through shared health evaluation so polling connections are not restarted on the WebSocket stale-socket heuristic. (#38395) Thanks @ql-wade and @Takhoffman.
- Daemon/systemd fresh-install probe: check for OpenClaw's managed user unit before running `systemctl --user is-enabled`, so first-time Linux installs no longer fail on generic missing-unit probe errors. (#38819) Thanks @adaHubble.
- Gateway/container lifecycle: allow `openclaw gateway stop` to SIGTERM unmanaged gateway listeners and `openclaw gateway restart` to SIGUSR1 a single unmanaged listener when no service manager is installed, so container and supervisor-based deployments are no longer blocked by `service disabled` no-op responses. Fixes #36137. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Windows restart supervision: relaunch task-managed gateways through Scheduled Task with quoted helper-script command paths, distinguish restart-capable supervisors per platform, and stop orphaned Windows gateway children during self-restart. (#38825) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/native topic command routing: resolve forum-topic native commands through the same conversation route as inbound messages so topic `agentId` overrides and bound topic sessions target the active session instead of the default topic-parent session. (#38871) Thanks @obviyus.
- Markdown/assistant image hardening: flatten remote markdown images to plain text across the Control UI, exported HTML, and shared Swift chat while keeping inline `data:image/...` markdown renderable, so model output no longer triggers automatic remote image fetches. (#38895) Thanks @obviyus.
- Config/compaction safeguard settings: regression-test `agents.defaults.compaction.recentTurnsPreserve` through `loadConfig()` and cover the new help metadata entry so the exposed preserve knob stays wired through schema validation and config UX. (#25557) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- iOS/Quick Setup presentation: skip automatic Quick Setup when a gateway is already configured (active connect config, last-known connection, preferred gateway, or manual host), so reconnecting installs no longer get prompted to connect again. (#38964) Thanks @ngutman.
- CLI/Docs memory help accuracy: clarify `openclaw memory status --deep` behavior and align memory command examples/docs with the current search options. (#31803) Thanks @JasonOA888 and @Avi974.
- Auto-reply/allowlist store account scoping: keep `/allowlist ... --store` writes scoped to the selected account and clear legacy unscoped entries when removing default-account store access, preventing cross-account default allowlist bleed-through from legacy pairing-store reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting and @vincentkoc for the fix.
- Security/Nostr: harden profile mutation/import loopback guards by failing closed on non-loopback forwarded client headers (`x-forwarded-for` / `x-real-ip`) and rejecting `sec-fetch-site: cross-site`; adds regression coverage for proxy-forwarded and browser cross-site mutation attempts.
- CLI/bootstrap Node version hint maintenance: replace hardcoded nvm `22` instructions in `openclaw.mjs` with `MIN_NODE_MAJOR` interpolation so future minimum-Node bumps keep startup guidance in sync automatically. (#39056) Thanks @onstash.
- Discord/native slash command auth: honor `commands.allowFrom.discord` (and `commands.allowFrom["*"]`) in guild slash-command pre-dispatch authorization so allowlisted senders are no longer incorrectly rejected as unauthorized. (#38794) Thanks @jskoiz and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Outbound/message target normalization: ignore empty legacy `to`/`channelId` fields when explicit `target` is provided so valid target-based sends no longer fail legacy-param validation; includes regression coverage. (#38944) Thanks @Narcooo.
- Models/auth token prompts: guard cancelled manual token prompts so `Symbol(clack:cancel)` values cannot be persisted into auth profiles; adds regression coverage for cancelled `models auth paste-token`. (#38951) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Gateway/loopback announce URLs: treat `http://` and `https://` aliases with the same loopback/private-network policy as websocket URLs so loopback cron announce delivery no longer fails secure URL validation. (#39064) Thanks @Narcooo.
- Models/default provider fallback: when the hardcoded default provider is removed from `models.providers`, resolve defaults from configured providers instead of reporting stale removed-provider defaults in status output. (#38947) Thanks @davidemanuelDEV.
- Agents/cache-trace stability: guard stable stringify against circular references in trace payloads so near-limit payloads no longer crash with `Maximum call stack size exceeded`; adds regression coverage. (#38935) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Extensions/diffs CI stability: add `headers` to the `localReq` test helper in `extensions/diffs/index.test.ts` so forwarding-hint checks no longer crash with `req.headers` undefined. (supersedes #39063) Thanks @Shennng.
- Agents/compaction thresholding: apply `agents.defaults.contextTokens` cap to the model passed into embedded run and `/compact` session creation so auto-compaction thresholds use the effective context window, not native model max context. (#39099) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Models/merge mode provider precedence: when `models.mode: "merge"` is active and config explicitly sets a provider `baseUrl`, keep config as source of truth instead of preserving stale runtime `models.json` `baseUrl` values; includes normalized provider-key coverage. (#39103) Thanks @BigUncle.
- UI/Control chat tool streaming: render tool events live in webchat without requiring refresh by enabling `tool-events` capability, fixing stream/event correlation, and resetting/reloading stream state around tool results and terminal events. (#39104) Thanks @jakepresent.
- Models/provider apiKey persistence hardening: when a provider `apiKey` value equals a known provider env var value, persist the canonical env var name into `models.json` instead of resolved plaintext secrets. (#38889) Thanks @gambletan.
- Discord/model picker persistence check: add a short post-dispatch settle delay before reading back session model state so picker confirmations stop reporting false mismatch warnings after successful model switches. (#39105) Thanks @akropp.
- Agents/OpenAI WS compat store flag: omit `store` from `response.create` payloads when model compat sets `supportsStore: false`, preventing strict OpenAI-compatible providers from rejecting websocket requests with unknown-field errors. (#39113) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Config/validation log sanitization: sanitize config-validation issue paths/messages before logging so control characters and ANSI escape sequences cannot inject misleading terminal output from crafted config content. (#39116) Thanks @powermaster888.
- Agents/compaction counter accuracy: count successful overflow-triggered auto-compactions (`willRetry=true`) in the compaction counter while still excluding aborted/no-result events, so `/status` reflects actual safeguard compaction activity. (#39123) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Gateway/chat delta ordering: flush buffered assistant deltas before emitting tool `start` events so pre-tool text is delivered to Control UI before tool cards, avoiding transient text/tool ordering artifacts in streaming. (#39128) Thanks @0xtangping.
- Voice-call plugin schema parity: add missing manifest `configSchema` fields (`webhookSecurity`, `streaming.preStartTimeoutMs|maxPendingConnections|maxPendingConnectionsPerIp|maxConnections`, `staleCallReaperSeconds`) so gateway AJV validation accepts already-supported runtime config instead of failing with `additionalProperties` errors. (#38892) Thanks @giumex.
- Agents/OpenAI WS reconnect retry accounting: avoid double retry scheduling when reconnect failures emit both `error` and `close`, so retry budgets track actual reconnect attempts instead of exhausting early. (#39133) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Daemon/Windows schtasks runtime detection: use locale-invariant `Last Run Result` running codes (`0x41301`/`267009`) as the primary running signal so `openclaw node status` no longer misreports active tasks as stopped on non-English Windows locales. (#39076) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Usage/token count formatting: round near-million token counts to millions (`1.0m`) instead of `1000k`, with explicit boundary coverage for `999_499` and `999_500`. (#39129) Thanks @CurryMessi.
- Gateway/session bootstrap cache invalidation ordering: clear bootstrap snapshots only after active embedded-run shutdown wait completes, preventing dying runs from repopulating stale cache between `/new`/`sessions.reset` turns. (#38873) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Browser/dispatcher error clarity: preserve dispatcher-side failure context in browser fetch errors while still appending operator guidance and explicit no-retry model hints, preventing misleading `"Can't reach service"` wrapping and avoiding LLM retry loops. (#39090) Thanks @NewdlDewdl.
- Telegram/polling offset safety: confirm persisted offsets before polling startup while validating stored `lastUpdateId` values as non-negative safe integers (with overflow guards) so malformed offset state cannot cause update skipping/dropping. (#39111) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Telegram/status SecretRef read-only resolution: resolve env-backed bot-token SecretRefs in config-only/status inspection while respecting provider source/defaults and env allowlists, so status no longer crashes or reports false-ready tokens for disallowed providers. (#39130) Thanks @neocody.
- Agents/OpenAI WS max-token zero forwarding: treat `maxTokens: 0` as an explicit value in websocket `response.create` payloads (instead of dropping it as falsy), with regression coverage for zero-token forwarding. (#39148) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Podman/.env gateway bind precedence: evaluate `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND` after sourcing `.env` in `run-openclaw-podman.sh` so env-file overrides are honored. (#38785) Thanks @majinyu666.
- Models/default alias refresh: bump `gpt` to `openai/gpt-5.4` and Gemini defaults to `gemini-3.1` preview aliases (including normalization/default wiring) to track current model IDs. (#38638) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Config/env substitution degraded mode: convert missing `${VAR}` resolution in config reads from hard-fail to warning-backed degraded behavior, while preventing unresolved placeholders from being accepted as gateway credentials. (#39050) Thanks @akz142857.
- Discord inbound listener non-blocking dispatch: make `MESSAGE_CREATE` listener handoff asynchronous (no per-listener queue blocking), so long runs no longer stall unrelated incoming events. (#39154) Thanks @yaseenkadlemakki.
- Daemon/Windows PATH freeze fix: stop persisting install-time `PATH` snapshots into Scheduled Task scripts so runtime tool lookup follows current host PATH updates; also refresh local TUI history on silent local finals. (#39139) Thanks @Narcooo.
- Gateway/systemd service restart hardening: clear stale gateway listeners by explicit run-port before service bind, add restart stale-pid port-override support, tune systemd start/stop/exit handling, and disable detached child mode only in service-managed runtime so cgroup stop semantics clean up descendants reliably. (#38463) Thanks @spirittechie.
- Discord/plugin native command aliases: let plugins declare provider-specific slash names so native Discord registration can avoid built-in command collisions; the bundled Talk voice plugin now uses `/talkvoice` natively on Discord while keeping text `/voice`.
- Daemon/Windows schtasks status normalization: derive runtime state from locale-neutral numeric `Last Run Result` codes only (without language string matching) and surface unknown when numeric result data is unavailable, preventing locale-specific misclassification drift. (#39153) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Telegram/polling conflict recovery: reset the polling `webhookCleared` latch on `getUpdates` 409 conflicts so webhook cleanup re-runs on restart cycles and polling avoids infinite conflict loops. (#39205) Thanks @amittell.
- Heartbeat/requests-in-flight scheduling: stop advancing `nextDueMs` and avoid immediate `scheduleNext()` timer overrides on requests-in-flight skips, so wake-layer retry cooldowns are honored and heartbeat cadence no longer drifts under sustained contention. (#39182) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Memory/SQLite contention resilience: re-apply `PRAGMA busy_timeout` on every sync-store and QMD connection open so process restarts/reopens no longer revert to immediate `SQLITE_BUSY` failures under lock contention. (#39183) Thanks @MumuTW.
- Gateway/webchat route safety: block webchat/control-ui clients from inheriting stored external delivery routes on channel-scoped sessions (while preserving route inheritance for UI/TUI clients), preventing cross-channel leakage from scoped chats. (#39175) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Telegram error-surface resilience: return a user-visible fallback reply when dispatch/debounce processing fails instead of going silent, while preserving draft-stream cleanup and best-effort thread-scoped fallback delivery. (#39209) Thanks @riftzen-bit.
- Gateway/password auth startup diagnostics: detect unresolved provider-reference objects in `gateway.auth.password` and fail with a specific bootstrap-secrets error message instead of generic misconfiguration output. (#39230) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Agents/OpenAI-responses compatibility: strip unsupported `store` payload fields when `supportsStore=false` (including OpenAI-compatible non-OpenAI providers) while preserving server-compaction payload behavior. (#39219) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Agents/model fallback visibility: warn when configured model IDs cannot be resolved and fallback is applied, with log-safe sanitization of model text to prevent control-sequence injection in warning output. (#39215) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Outbound delivery replay safety: use two-phase delivery ACK markers (`.json` -> `.delivered` -> unlink) and startup marker cleanup so crash windows between send and cleanup do not replay already-delivered messages. (#38668) Thanks @Gundam98.
- Nodes/system.run approval binding: carry prepared approval plans through gateway forwarding and bind interpreter-style script operands across approval to execution, so post-approval script rewrites are denied while unchanged approved script runs keep working. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Nodes/system.run PowerShell wrapper parsing: treat `pwsh`/`powershell` `-EncodedCommand` forms as shell-wrapper payloads so allowlist mode still requires approval instead of falling back to plain argv analysis. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Control UI/auth error reporting: map generic browser `Fetch failed` websocket close errors back to actionable gateway auth messages (`gateway token mismatch`, `authentication failed`, `retry later`) so dashboard disconnects stop hiding credential problems. Landed from contributor PR #28608 by @KimGLee. Thanks @KimGLee.
- Media/mime unknown-kind handling: return `undefined` (not `"unknown"`) for missing/unrecognized MIME kinds and use document-size fallback caps for unknown remote media, preventing phantom `<media:unknown>` Signal events from being treated as real messages. (#39199) Thanks @nicolasgrasset.
- Nodes/system.run allow-always persistence: honor shell comment semantics during allowlist analysis so `#`-tailed payloads that never execute are not persisted as trusted follow-up commands. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Signal/inbound attachment fan-in: forward all successfully fetched inbound attachments through `MediaPaths`/`MediaUrls`/`MediaTypes` (instead of only the first), and improve multi-attachment placeholder summaries in mention-gated pending history. (#39212) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Nodes/system.run dispatch-wrapper boundary: keep shell-wrapper approval classification active at the depth boundary so `env` wrapper stacks cannot reach `/bin/sh -c` execution without the expected approval gate. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Docker/token persistence on reconfigure: reuse the existing `.env` gateway token during `docker-setup.sh` reruns and align compose token env defaults, so Docker installs stop silently rotating tokens and breaking existing dashboard sessions. Landed from contributor PR #33097 by @chengzhichao-xydt. Thanks @chengzhichao-xydt.
- Agents/strict OpenAI turn ordering: apply assistant-first transcript bootstrap sanitization to strict OpenAI-compatible providers (for example vLLM/Gemma via `openai-completions`) without adding Google-specific session markers, preventing assistant-first history rejections. (#39252) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Discord/exec approvals gateway auth: pass resolved shared gateway credentials into the Discord exec-approvals gateway client so token-auth installs stop failing approvals with `gateway token mismatch`. Related to #38179. Thanks @0riginal-claw for the adjacent PR #35147 investigation.
- Subagents/workspace inheritance: propagate parent workspace directory to spawned subagent runs so child sessions reliably inherit workspace-scoped instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, etc.) without exposing workspace override through tool-call arguments. (#39247) Thanks @jasonQin6.
- Exec approvals/gateway-node policy: honor explicit `ask=off` from `exec-approvals.json` even when runtime defaults are stricter, so trusted full/off setups stop re-prompting on gateway and node exec paths. Landed from contributor PR #26789 by @pandego. Thanks @pandego.
- Exec approvals/config fallback: inherit `ask` from `exec-approvals.json` when `tools.exec.ask` is unset, so local full/off defaults no longer fall back to `on-miss` for exec tool and `nodes run`. Landed from contributor PR #29187 by @Bartok9. Thanks @Bartok9.
- Exec approvals/allow-always shell scripts: persist and match script paths for wrapper invocations like `bash scripts/foo.sh` while still blocking `-c`/`-s` wrapper bypasses. Landed from contributor PR #35137 by @yuweuii. Thanks @yuweuii.
- Queue/followup dedupe across drain restarts: dedupe queued redelivery `message_id` values after queue recreation so busy-session followups no longer duplicate on replayed inbound events. Landed from contributor PR #33168 by @rylena. Thanks @rylena.
- Telegram/preview-final edit idempotence: treat `message is not modified` errors during preview finalization as delivered so partial-stream final replies do not fall back to duplicate sends. Landed from contributor PR #34983 by @HOYALIM. Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Telegram/DM streaming transport parity: use message preview transport for all DM streaming lanes so final delivery can edit the active preview instead of sending duplicate finals. Landed from contributor PR #38906 by @gambletan. Thanks @gambletan.
- Telegram/DM draft streaming restoration: restore native `sendMessageDraft` preview transport for DM answer streaming while keeping reasoning on message transport, with regression coverage to keep draft finalization from sending duplicate finals. (#39398) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/send retry safety: retry non-idempotent send paths only for pre-connect failures and make custom retry predicates strict, preventing ambiguous reconnect retries from sending duplicate messages. Landed from contributor PR #34238 by @hal-crackbot. Thanks @hal-crackbot.
- ACP/run spawn delivery bootstrap: stop reusing requester inline delivery targets for one-shot `mode: "run"` ACP spawns, so fresh run-mode workers bootstrap in isolation instead of inheriting thread-bound session delivery behavior. (#39014) Thanks @lidamao633.
- Discord/DM session-key normalization: rewrite legacy `discord:dm:*` and phantom direct-message `discord:channel:<user>` session keys to `discord:direct:*` when the sender matches, so multi-agent Discord DMs stop falling into empty channel-shaped sessions and resume replying correctly.
- Discord/native slash session fallback: treat empty configured bound-session keys as missing so `/status` and other native commands fall back to the routed slash session and routed channel session instead of blanking Discord session keys in normal channel bindings.
- Agents/tool-call dispatch normalization: normalize provider-prefixed tool names before dispatch across `toolCall`, `toolUse`, and `functionCall` blocks, while preserving multi-segment tool suffixes when stripping provider wrappers so malformed-but-recoverable tool names no longer fail with `Tool not found`. (#39328) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/parallel tool-call compatibility: honor `parallel_tool_calls` / `parallelToolCalls` extra params only for `openai-completions` and `openai-responses` payloads, preserve higher-precedence alias overrides across config and runtime layers, and ignore invalid non-boolean values so single-tool-call providers like NVIDIA-hosted Kimi stop failing on forced parallel tool-call payloads. (#37048) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Config/invalid-load fail-closed: stop converting `INVALID_CONFIG` into an empty runtime config, keep valid settings available only through explicit best-effort diagnostic reads, and route read-only CLI diagnostics through that path so unknown keys no longer silently drop security-sensitive config. (#28140) Thanks @bobsahur-robot and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/codex-cli sandbox defaults: switch the built-in Codex backend from `read-only` to `workspace-write` so spawned coding runs can edit files out of the box. Landed from contributor PR #39336 by @0xtangping. Thanks @0xtangping.
- Gateway/health-monitor restart reason labeling: report `disconnected` instead of `stuck` for clean channel disconnect restarts, so operator logs distinguish socket drops from genuinely stuck channels. (#36436) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Control UI/agents-page overrides: auto-create minimal per-agent config entries when editing inherited agents, so model/tool/skill changes enable Save and inherited model fallbacks can be cleared by writing a primary-only override. Landed from contributor PR #39326 by @dunamismax. Thanks @dunamismax.
- Gateway/Telegram webhook-mode recovery: add `webhookCertPath` to re-upload self-signed certificates during webhook registration and skip stale-socket detection for webhook-mode channels, so Telegram webhook setups survive health-monitor restarts. Landed from contributor PR #39313 by @fellanH. Thanks @fellanH.
- Discord/config schema parity: add `channels.discord.agentComponents` to the strict Zod config schema so valid `agentComponents.enabled` settings (root and account-scoped) no longer fail with unrecognized-key validation errors. Landed from contributor PR #39378 by @gambletan. Thanks @gambletan and @thewilloftheshadow.
- ACPX/MCP session bootstrap: inject configured MCP servers into ACP `session/new` and `session/load` for acpx-backed sessions, restoring Canva and other external MCP tools. Landed from contributor PR #39337. Thanks @goodspeed-apps.
- Control UI/Telegram sender labels: preserve inbound sender labels in sanitized chat history so dashboard user-message groups split correctly and show real group-member names instead of `You`. (#39414) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/failover 402 recovery: keep temporary spend-limit `402` payloads retryable, preserve explicit insufficient-credit billing detection even in long provider payloads, and allow throttled billing-cooldown probes so single-provider setups can recover instead of staying locked out. (#38533) Thanks @xialonglee.
- Browser/config schema: accept `browser.profiles.*.driver: "openclaw"` while preserving legacy `"clawd"` compatibility in validated config. (#39374; based on #35621) Thanks @gambletan and @ingyukoh.
- Memory flush/bootstrap file protection: restrict memory-flush runs to append-only `read`/`write` tools and route host-side memory appends through root-enforced safe file handles so flush turns cannot overwrite bootstrap files via `exec` or unsafe raw rewrites. (#38574) Thanks @frankekn.
- Mattermost/DM media uploads: resolve bare 26-character Mattermost IDs user-first for direct messages so media sends no longer fail with `403 Forbidden` when targets are configured as unprefixed user IDs. (#29925) Thanks @teconomix.
- Voice-call/OpenAI TTS config parity: add missing `speed`, `instructions`, and `baseUrl` fields to the OpenAI TTS config schema and gate `instructions` to supported models so voice-call overrides validate and route cleanly through core TTS. (#39226) Thanks @ademczuk.

## 2026.3.2

### Changes

- Secrets/SecretRef coverage: expand SecretRef support across the full supported user-supplied credential surface (64 targets total), including runtime collectors, `openclaw secrets` planning/apply/audit flows, onboarding SecretInput UX, and related docs; unresolved refs now fail fast on active surfaces while inactive surfaces report non-blocking diagnostics. (#29580) Thanks @joshavant.
- Tools/PDF analysis: add a first-class `pdf` tool with native Anthropic and Google PDF provider support, extraction fallback for non-native models, configurable defaults (`agents.defaults.pdfModel`, `pdfMaxBytesMb`, `pdfMaxPages`), and docs/tests covering routing, validation, and registration. (#31319) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Outbound adapters/plugins: add shared `sendPayload` support across direct-text-media, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Zalo, and Zalouser with multi-media iteration and chunk-aware text fallback. (#30144) Thanks @nohat.
- Models/MiniMax: add first-class `MiniMax-M2.5-highspeed` support across built-in provider catalogs, onboarding flows, and MiniMax OAuth plugin defaults, while keeping legacy `MiniMax-M2.5-Lightning` compatibility for existing configs.
- Sessions/Attachments: add inline file attachment support for `sessions_spawn` (subagent runtime only) with base64/utf8 encoding, transcript content redaction, lifecycle cleanup, and configurable limits via `tools.sessions_spawn.attachments`. (#16761) Thanks @napetrov.
- Telegram/Streaming defaults: default `channels.telegram.streaming` to `partial` (from `off`) so new Telegram setups get live preview streaming out of the box, with runtime fallback to message-edit preview when native drafts are unavailable.
- Telegram/DM streaming: use `sendMessageDraft` for private preview streaming, keep reasoning/answer preview lanes separated in DM reasoning-stream mode. (#31824) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/voice mention gating: add optional `disableAudioPreflight` on group/topic config to skip mention-detection preflight transcription for inbound voice notes where operators want text-only mention checks. (#23067) Thanks @yangnim21029.
- CLI/Config validation: add `openclaw config validate` (with `--json`) to validate config files before gateway startup, and include detailed invalid-key paths in startup invalid-config errors. (#31220) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Tools/Diffs: add PDF file output support and rendering quality customization controls (`fileQuality`, `fileScale`, `fileMaxWidth`) for generated diff artifacts, and document PDF as the preferred option when messaging channels compress images. (#31342) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Memory/Ollama embeddings: add `memorySearch.provider = "ollama"` and `memorySearch.fallback = "ollama"` support, honor `models.providers.ollama` settings for memory embedding requests, and document Ollama embedding usage. (#26349) Thanks @nico-hoff.
- Zalo Personal plugin (`@openclaw/zalouser`): rebuilt channel runtime to use native `zca-js` integration in-process, removing external CLI transport usage and keeping QR/login + send/listen flows fully inside OpenClaw.
- Plugin SDK/channel extensibility: expose `channelRuntime` on `ChannelGatewayContext` so external channel plugins can access shared runtime helpers (reply/routing/session/text/media/commands) without internal imports. (#25462) Thanks @guxiaobo.
- Plugin runtime/STT: add `api.runtime.stt.transcribeAudioFile(...)` so extensions can transcribe local audio files through OpenClaw's configured media-understanding audio providers. (#22402) Thanks @benthecarman.
- Plugin hooks/session lifecycle: include `sessionKey` in `session_start`/`session_end` hook events and contexts so plugins can correlate lifecycle callbacks with routing identity. (#26394) Thanks @tempeste.
- Hooks/message lifecycle: add internal hook events `message:transcribed` and `message:preprocessed`, plus richer outbound `message:sent` context (`isGroup`, `groupId`) for group-conversation correlation and post-transcription automations. (#9859) Thanks @Drickon.
- Media understanding/audio echo: add optional `tools.media.audio.echoTranscript` + `echoFormat` to send a pre-agent transcript confirmation message to the originating chat, with echo disabled by default. (#32150) Thanks @AytuncYildizli.
- Plugin runtime/system: expose `runtime.system.requestHeartbeatNow(...)` so extensions can wake targeted sessions immediately after enqueueing system events. (#19464) Thanks @AustinEral.
- Plugin runtime/events: expose `runtime.events.onAgentEvent` and `runtime.events.onSessionTranscriptUpdate` for extension-side subscriptions, and isolate transcript-listener failures so one faulty listener cannot break the entire update fanout. (#16044) Thanks @scifantastic.
- CLI/Banner taglines: add `cli.banner.taglineMode` (`random` | `default` | `off`) to control funny tagline behavior in startup output, with docs + FAQ guidance and regression tests for config override behavior.
- Agents/compaction safeguard quality-audit rollout: keep summary quality audits disabled by default unless `agents.defaults.compaction.qualityGuard` is explicitly enabled, and add config plumbing for bounded retry control. (#25556) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/input_image MIME validation: sniff uploaded image bytes before MIME allowlist enforcement again so declared image types cannot mask concrete non-image payloads, while keeping HEIC/HEIF normalization behavior scoped to actual HEIC inputs. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Zalo Personal plugin (`@openclaw/zalouser`): keep canonical DM routing while preserving legacy DM session continuity on upgrade, and preserve provider-native `g-`/`u-` target ids in outbound send and directory flows so #33992 lands without breaking existing sessions or stored targets. (#33992) Thanks @darkamenosa.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Onboarding now defaults `tools.profile` to `messaging` for new local installs (interactive + non-interactive). New setups no longer start with broad coding/system tools unless explicitly configured.
- **BREAKING:** ACP dispatch now defaults to enabled unless explicitly disabled (`acp.dispatch.enabled=false`). If you need to pause ACP turn routing while keeping `/acp` controls, set `acp.dispatch.enabled=false`. Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/acp-agents
- **BREAKING:** Plugin SDK removed `api.registerHttpHandler(...)`. Plugins must register explicit HTTP routes via `api.registerHttpRoute({ path, auth, match, handler })`, and dynamic webhook lifecycles should use `registerPluginHttpRoute(...)`.
- **BREAKING:** Zalo Personal plugin (`@openclaw/zalouser`) no longer depends on external `zca`-compatible CLI binaries (`openzca`, `zca-cli`) for runtime send/listen/login; operators should use `openclaw channels login --channel zalouser` after upgrade to refresh sessions in the new JS-native path.

### Fixes

- Feishu/Outbound render mode: respect Feishu account `renderMode` in outbound sends so card mode (and auto-detected markdown tables/code blocks) uses markdown card delivery instead of always sending plain text. (#31562) Thanks @arkyu2077.
- Plugin command/runtime hardening: validate and normalize plugin command name/description at registration boundaries, and guard Telegram native menu normalization paths so malformed plugin command specs cannot crash startup (`trim` on undefined). (#31997) Fixes #31944. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Telegram: guard duplicate-token checks and gateway startup token normalization when account tokens are missing, preventing `token.trim()` crashes during status/start flows. (#31973) Thanks @ningding97.
- Discord/lifecycle startup status: push an immediate `connected` status snapshot when the gateway is already connected before lifecycle debug listeners attach, with abort-guarding to avoid contradictory status flips during pre-aborted startup. (#32336) Thanks @mitchmcalister.
- Feishu/inbound mention normalization: preserve all inbound mention semantics by normalizing Feishu mention placeholders into explicit `<at user_id=\"...\">name</at>` tags (instead of stripping them), improving multi-mention context fidelity in agent prompts while retaining bot/self mention disambiguation. (#30252) Thanks @Lanfei.
- Feishu/multi-app mention routing: guard mention detection in multi-bot groups by validating mention display name alongside bot `open_id`, preventing false-positive self-mentions from Feishu WebSocket remapping so only the actually mentioned bot responds under `requireMention`. (#30315) Thanks @teaguexiao.
- Feishu/session-memory hook parity: trigger the shared `before_reset` session-memory hook path when Feishu `/new` and `/reset` commands execute so reset flows preserve memory behavior consistent with other channels. (#31437) Thanks @Linux2010.
- Feishu/LINE group system prompts: forward per-group `systemPrompt` config into inbound context `GroupSystemPrompt` for Feishu and LINE group/room events so configured group-specific behavior actually applies at dispatch time. (#31713) Thanks @whiskyboy.
- Mentions/Slack formatting hardening: add null-safe guards for runtime text normalization paths so malformed/undefined text payloads do not crash mention stripping or mrkdwn conversion. (#31865) Thanks @stone-jin.
- Feishu/Plugin sdk compatibility: add safe webhook default fallbacks when loading Feishu monitor state so mixed-version installs no longer crash if older `openclaw/plugin-sdk` builds omit webhook default constants. (#31606)
- Feishu/group broadcast dispatch: add configurable multi-agent group broadcast dispatch with observer-session isolation, cross-account dedupe safeguards, and non-mention history buffering rules that avoid duplicate replay in broadcast/topic workflows. (#29575) Thanks @ohmyskyhigh.
- Gateway/Subagent TLS pairing: allow authenticated local `gateway-client` backend self-connections to skip device pairing while still requiring pairing for non-local/direct-host paths, restoring `sessions_spawn` with `gateway.tls.enabled=true` in Docker/LAN setups. Fixes #30740. Thanks @Sid-Qin and @vincentkoc.
- Browser/CDP startup diagnostics: include Chrome stderr output and a Linux no-sandbox hint in startup timeout errors so failed launches are easier to diagnose. (#29312) Thanks @veast.
- Synology Chat/webhook ingress hardening: enforce bounded body reads (size + timeout) via shared request-body guards to prevent unauthenticated slow-body hangs before token validation. (#25831) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Feishu/Dedup restart resilience: warm persistent dedup state into memory on monitor startup so retry events after gateway restart stay suppressed without requiring initial on-disk probe misses. (#31605)
- Voice-call/runtime lifecycle: prevent `EADDRINUSE` loops by resetting failed runtime promises, making webhook `start()` idempotent with the actual bound port, and fully cleaning up webhook/tunnel/tailscale resources after startup failures. (#32395) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Gateway/Security hardening: tie loopback-origin dev allowance to actual local socket clients (not Host header claims), add explicit warnings/metrics when `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback` accepts websocket origins, harden safe-regex detection for quantified ambiguous alternation patterns (for example `(a|aa)+`), and bound large regex-evaluation inputs for session-filter and log-redaction paths.
- Gateway/Plugin HTTP hardening: require explicit `auth` for plugin route registration, add route ownership guards for duplicate `path+match` registrations, centralize plugin path matching/auth logic into dedicated modules, and share webhook target-route lifecycle wiring across channel monitors to avoid stale or conflicting registrations. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Browser/Profile defaults: prefer `openclaw` profile over `chrome` in headless/no-sandbox environments unless an explicit `defaultProfile` is configured. (#14944) Thanks @BenediktSchackenberg.
- Gateway/WS security: keep plaintext `ws://` loopback-only by default, with explicit break-glass private-network opt-in via `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1`; align onboarding/client/call validation and tests to this strict-default policy. (#28670) Thanks @dashed, @vincentkoc.
- OpenAI Codex OAuth/TLS prerequisites: add an OAuth TLS cert-chain preflight with actionable remediation for cert trust failures, and gate doctor TLS prerequisite probing to OpenAI Codex OAuth-configured installs (or explicit `doctor --deep`) to avoid unconditional outbound probe latency. (#32051) Thanks @alexfilatov.
- Security/Webhook request hardening: enforce auth-before-body parsing for BlueBubbles and Google Chat webhook handlers, add strict pre-auth body/time budgets for webhook auth paths (including LINE signature verification), and add shared in-flight/request guardrails plus regression tests/lint checks to prevent reintroducing unauthenticated slow-body DoS patterns. Thanks @GCXWLP for reporting.
- CLI/Config validation and routing hardening: dedupe `openclaw config validate` failures to a single authoritative report, expose allowed-values metadata/hints across core Zod and plugin AJV validation (including `--json` fields), sanitize terminal-rendered validation text, and make command-path parsing root-option-aware across preaction/route/lazy registration (including routed `config get/unset` with split root options). Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Browser/Extension relay reconnect tolerance: keep `/json/version` and `/cdp` reachable during short MV3 worker disconnects when attached targets still exist, and retain clients across reconnect grace windows. (#30232) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- CLI/Browser start timeout: honor `openclaw browser --timeout <ms> start` and stop by removing the fixed 15000ms override so slower Chrome startups can use caller-provided timeouts. (#22412, #23427) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Synology Chat/gateway lifecycle: keep `startAccount` pending until abort for inactive and active account paths to prevent webhook route restart loops under gateway supervision. (#23074) Thanks @druide67.
- Exec approvals/allowlist matching: escape regex metacharacters in path-pattern literals (while preserving glob wildcards), preventing crashes on allowlisted executables like `/usr/bin/g++` and correctly matching mixed wildcard/literal token paths. (#32162) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Synology Chat/webhook compatibility: accept JSON and alias payload fields, allow token resolution from body/query/header sources, and ACK webhook requests with `204` to avoid persistent `Processing...` states in Synology Chat clients. (#26635) Thanks @memphislee09-source.
- Voice-call/Twilio signature verification: retry signature validation across deterministic URL port variants (with/without port) to handle mixed Twilio signing behavior behind reverse proxies and non-standard ports. (#25140) Thanks @drvoss.
- Slack/Bolt startup compatibility: remove invalid `message.channels` and `message.groups` event registrations so Slack providers no longer crash on startup with Bolt 4.6+; channel/group traffic continues through the unified `message` handler (`channel_type`). (#32033) Thanks @mahopan.
- Slack/socket auth failure handling: fail fast on non-recoverable auth errors (`account_inactive`, `invalid_auth`, etc.) during startup and reconnect instead of retry-looping indefinitely, including `unable_to_socket_mode_start` error payload propagation. (#32377) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Gateway/macOS LaunchAgent hardening: write `Umask=077` in generated gateway LaunchAgent plists so npm upgrades preserve owner-only default file permissions for gateway-created state files. (#31919) Fixes #31905. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- macOS/LaunchAgent security defaults: write `Umask=63` (octal `077`) into generated gateway launchd plists so post-update service reinstalls keep owner-only file permissions by default instead of falling back to system `022`. (#32022) Fixes #31905. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Media understanding/provider HTTP proxy routing: pass a proxy-aware fetch function from `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` env vars into audio/video provider calls (with graceful malformed-proxy fallback) so transcription/video requests honor configured outbound proxies. (#27093) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Sandbox/workspace mount permissions: make primary `/workspace` bind mounts read-only whenever `workspaceAccess` is not `rw` (including `none`) across both core sandbox container and sandbox browser create flows. (#32227) Thanks @guanyu-zhang.
- Tools/fsPolicy propagation: honor `tools.fs.workspaceOnly` for image/pdf local-root allowlists so non-sandbox media paths outside workspace are rejected when workspace-only mode is enabled. (#31882) Thanks @justinhuangcode.
- Daemon/Homebrew runtime pinning: resolve Homebrew Cellar Node paths to stable Homebrew-managed symlinks (including versioned formulas like `node@22`) so gateway installs keep the intended runtime across brew upgrades. (#32185) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Browser/Security output boundary hardening: replace check-then-rename output commits with root-bound fd-verified writes, unify install/skills canonical path-boundary checks, and add regression coverage for symlink-rebind race paths across browser output and shared fs-safe write flows. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gateway/Security canonicalization hardening: decode plugin route path variants to canonical fixpoint (with bounded depth), fail closed on canonicalization anomalies, and enforce gateway auth for deeply encoded `/api/channels/*` variants to prevent alternate-path auth bypass through plugin handlers. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Browser/Gateway hardening: preserve env credentials for `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` / `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_URL` while treating explicit `--url` as override-only auth, and make container browser hardening flags optional with safer defaults for Docker/LXC stability. (#31504) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Control UI basePath webhook passthrough: let non-read methods under configured `controlUiBasePath` fall through to plugin routes (instead of returning Control UI 405), restoring webhook handlers behind basePath mounts. (#32311) Thanks @ademczuk.
- Gateway/Webchat streaming finalization: flush throttled trailing assistant text before `final` chat events so streaming consumers do not miss tail content, while preserving duplicate suppression and heartbeat/silent lead-fragment guards. (#24856) Thanks @visionik and @vincentkoc.
- Control UI/Legacy browser compatibility: replace `toSorted`-dependent cron suggestion sorting in `app-render` with a compatibility helper so older browsers without `Array.prototype.toSorted` no longer white-screen. (#31775) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- macOS/PeekabooBridge: add compatibility socket symlinks for legacy `clawdbot`, `clawdis`, and `moltbot` Application Support socket paths so pre-rename clients can still connect. (#6033) Thanks @lumpinif and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/message tool reliability: avoid false `Unknown channel` failures when `message.*` actions receive platform-specific channel ids by falling back to `toolContext.currentChannelProvider`, and prevent health-monitor restart thrash for channels that just (re)started by adding a per-channel startup-connect grace window. (from #32367) Thanks @MunemHashmi.
- Windows/Spawn canonicalization: unify non-core Windows spawn handling across ACP client, QMD/mcporter memory paths, and sandbox Docker execution using the shared wrapper-resolution policy, with targeted regression coverage for `.cmd` shim unwrapping and shell fallback behavior. (#31750) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Security/ACP sandbox inheritance: enforce fail-closed runtime guardrails for `sessions_spawn` with `runtime="acp"` by rejecting ACP spawns from sandboxed requester sessions and rejecting `sandbox="require"` for ACP runtime, preventing sandbox-boundary bypass via host-side ACP initialization. (#32254) Thanks @tdjackey for reporting, and @dutifulbob for the fix.
- Security/Web tools SSRF guard: keep DNS pinning for untrusted `web_fetch` and citation-redirect URL checks when proxy env vars are set, and require explicit dangerous opt-in before env-proxy routing can bypass pinned dispatch for trusted/operator-controlled endpoints. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gemini schema sanitization: coerce malformed JSON Schema `properties` values (`null`, arrays, primitives) to `{}` before provider validation, preventing downstream strict-validator crashes on invalid plugin/tool schemas. (#32332) Thanks @webdevtodayjason.
- Media understanding/malformed attachment guards: harden attachment selection and decision summary formatting against non-array or malformed attachment payloads to prevent runtime crashes on invalid inbound metadata shapes. (#28024) Thanks @claw9267.
- Browser/Extension navigation reattach: preserve debugger re-attachment when relay is temporarily disconnected by deferring relay attach events until reconnect/re-announce, reducing post-navigation tab loss. (#28725) Thanks @stone-jin.
- Browser/Extension relay stale tabs: evict stale cached targets from `/json/list` when extension targets are destroyed/crashed or commands fail with missing target/session errors. (#6175) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Browser/CDP startup readiness: wait for CDP websocket readiness after launching Chrome and cleanly stop/reset when readiness never arrives, reducing follow-up `PortInUseError` races after `browser start`/`open`. (#29538) Thanks @AaronWander.
- OpenAI/Responses WebSocket tool-call id hygiene: normalize blank/whitespace streamed tool-call ids before persistence, and block empty `function_call_output.call_id` payloads in the WS conversion path to avoid OpenAI 400 errors (`Invalid 'input[n].call_id': empty string`), with regression coverage for both inbound stream normalization and outbound payload guards.
- Security/Nodes camera URL downloads: bind node `camera.snap`/`camera.clip` URL payload downloads to the resolved node host, enforce fail-closed behavior when node `remoteIp` is unavailable, and use SSRF-guarded fetch with redirect host/protocol checks to prevent off-node fetch pivots. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Config/backups hardening: enforce owner-only (`0600`) permissions on rotated config backups and clean orphan `.bak.*` files outside the managed backup ring, reducing credential leakage risk from stale or permissive backup artifacts. (#31718) Thanks @YUJIE2002.
- Telegram/inbound media filenames: preserve original `file_name` metadata for document/audio/video/animation downloads (with fetch/path fallbacks), so saved inbound attachments keep sender-provided names instead of opaque Telegram file paths. (#31837) Thanks @Kay-051.
- Gateway/OpenAI chat completions: honor `x-openclaw-message-channel` when building `agentCommand` input for `/v1/chat/completions`, preserving caller channel identity instead of forcing `webchat`. (#30462) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Plugin SDK/runtime hardening: add package export verification in CI/release checks to catch missing runtime exports before publish-time regressions. (#28575) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Media/MIME normalization: normalize parameterized/case-variant MIME strings in `kindFromMime` (for example `Audio/Ogg; codecs=opus`) so WhatsApp voice notes are classified as audio and routed through transcription correctly. (#32280) Thanks @Lucenx9.
- Discord/audio preflight mentions: detect audio attachments via Discord `content_type` and gate preflight transcription on typed text (not media placeholders), so guild voice-note mentions are transcribed and matched correctly. (#32136) Thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Discord/acp inline actions: prefer autocomplete for `/acp` action inline values and ignore bound-thread bot system messages to prevent ACP loops. (#33136) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Feishu/topic session routing: use `thread_id` as topic session scope fallback when `root_id` is absent, keep first-turn topic keys stable across thread creation, and force thread replies when inbound events already carry topic/thread context. (#29788) Thanks @songyaolun.
- Gateway/Webchat NO_REPLY streaming: suppress assistant lead-fragment deltas that are prefixes of `NO_REPLY` and keep final-message buffering in sync, preventing partial `NO` leaks on silent-response runs while preserving legitimate short replies. (#32073) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Telegram/models picker callbacks: keep long model buttons selectable by falling back to compact callback payloads and resolving provider ids on selection (with provider re-prompt on ambiguity), avoiding Telegram 64-byte callback truncation failures. (#31857) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Context-window metadata warmup: add exponential config-load retry backoff (1s -> 2s -> 4s, capped at 60s) so transient startup failures recover automatically without hot-loop retries.
- Voice-call/Twilio external outbound: auto-register webhook-first `outbound-api` calls (initiated outside OpenClaw) so media streams are accepted and call direction metadata stays accurate. (#31181) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Feishu/topic root replies: prefer `root_id` as outbound `replyTargetMessageId` when present, and parse millisecond `message_create_time` values correctly so topic replies anchor to the root message in grouped thread flows. (#29968) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Feishu/DM pairing reply target: send pairing challenge replies to `chat:<chat_id>` instead of `user:<sender_open_id>` so Lark/Feishu private chats with user-id-only sender payloads receive pairing messages reliably. (#31403) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Feishu/Lark private DM routing: treat inbound `chat_type: "private"` as direct-message context for pairing/mention-forward/reaction synthetic handling so Lark private chats behave like Feishu p2p DMs. (#31400) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Feishu/streaming card transport error handling: check `response.ok` before parsing JSON in token and card create requests so non-JSON HTTP error responses surface deterministic status failures. (#35628) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Signal/message actions: allow `react` to fall back to `toolContext.currentMessageId` when `messageId` is omitted, matching Telegram behavior and unblocking agent-initiated reactions on inbound turns. (#32217) Thanks @dunamismax.
- Discord/message actions: allow `react` to fall back to `toolContext.currentMessageId` when `messageId` is omitted, matching Telegram/Signal reaction ergonomics in inbound turns.
- Synology Chat/reply delivery: resolve webhook usernames to Chat API `user_id` values for outbound chatbot replies, avoiding mismatches between webhook user IDs and `method=chatbot` recipient IDs in multi-account setups. (#23709) Thanks @druide67.
- Slack/thread context payloads: only inject thread starter/history text on first thread turn for new sessions while preserving thread metadata, reducing repeated context-token bloat on long-lived thread sessions. (#32133) Thanks @sourman.
- Slack/session routing: keep top-level channel messages in one shared session when `replyToMode=off`, while preserving thread-scoped keys for true thread replies and non-off modes. (#32193) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Slack/app_mention dedupe race handling: keep seen-message dedupe to prevent duplicate replies while allowing a one-time app_mention retry when the paired message event was dropped pre-dispatch, so requireMention channels do not lose mentions under Slack event reordering. (#34937) Thanks @littleben.
- Voice-call/webhook routing: require exact webhook path matches (instead of prefix matches) so lookalike paths cannot reach provider verification/dispatch logic. (#31930) Thanks @afurm.
- Zalo/Pairing auth tests: add webhook regression coverage asserting DM pairing-store reads/writes remain account-scoped, preventing cross-account authorization bleed in multi-account setups. (#26121) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Zalouser/Pairing auth tests: add account-scoped DM pairing-store regression coverage (`monitor.account-scope.test.ts`) to prevent cross-account allowlist bleed in multi-account setups. (#26672) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Feishu/Send target prefixes: normalize explicit `group:`/`dm:` send targets and preserve explicit receive-id routing hints when resolving outbound Feishu targets. (#31594) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Webchat/Feishu session continuation: preserve routable `OriginatingChannel`/`OriginatingTo` metadata from session delivery context in `chat.send`, and prefer provider-normalized channel when deciding cross-channel route dispatch so Webchat replies continue on the selected Feishu session instead of falling back to main/internal session routing. (#31573)
- Telegram/implicit mention forum handling: exclude Telegram forum system service messages (`forum_topic_*`, `general_forum_topic_*`) from reply-chain implicit mention detection so `requireMention` does not get bypassed inside bot-created topic lifecycle events. (#32262) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Slack/inbound debounce routing: isolate top-level non-DM message debounce keys by message timestamp to avoid cross-thread collisions, preserve DM batching, and flush pending top-level buffers before immediate non-debounce follow-ups to keep ordering stable. (#31951) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Feishu/Duplicate replies: suppress same-target reply dispatch when message-tool sends use generic provider metadata (`provider: "message"`) and normalize `lark`/`feishu` provider aliases during duplicate-target checks, preventing double-delivery in Feishu sessions. (#31526)
- Webchat/silent token leak: filter assistant `NO_REPLY`-only transcript entries from `chat.history` responses and add client-side defense-in-depth guards in the chat controller so internal silent tokens never render as visible chat bubbles. (#32015) Consolidates overlap from #32183, #32082, #32045, #32052, #32172, and #32112. Thanks @ademczuk, @liuxiaopai-ai, @ningding97, @bmendonca3, and @x4v13r1120.
- Doctor/local memory provider checks: stop false-positive local-provider warnings when `provider=local` and no explicit `modelPath` is set by honoring default local model fallback while still warning when gateway probe reports local embeddings not ready. (#32014) Fixes #31998. Thanks @adhishthite.
- Media understanding/parakeet CLI output parsing: read `parakeet-mlx` transcripts from `--output-dir/<media-basename>.txt` when txt output is requested (or default), with stdout fallback for non-txt formats. (#9177) Thanks @mac-110.
- Media understanding/audio transcription guard: skip tiny/empty audio files (<1024 bytes) before provider/CLI transcription to avoid noisy invalid-audio failures and preserve clean fallback behavior. (#8388) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Gateway/Plugin HTTP route precedence: run explicit plugin HTTP routes before the Control UI SPA catch-all so registered plugin webhook/custom paths remain reachable, while unmatched paths still fall through to Control UI handling. (#31885) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Gateway/Node browser proxy routing: honor `profile` from `browser.request` JSON body when query params omit it, while preserving query-profile precedence when both are present. (#28852) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Gateway/Control UI basePath POST handling: return 405 for `POST` on exact basePath routes (for example `/openclaw`) instead of redirecting, and add end-to-end regression coverage that root-mounted webhook POST paths still pass through to plugin handlers. (#31349) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Browser/default profile selection: default `browser.defaultProfile` behavior now prefers `openclaw` (managed standalone CDP) when no explicit default is configured, while still auto-provisioning the `chrome` relay profile for explicit opt-in use. (#32031) Fixes #31907. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Sandbox/mkdirp boundary checks: allow existing in-boundary directories to pass mkdirp boundary validation when directory open probes return platform-specific I/O errors, with regression coverage for directory-safe fallback behavior. (#31547) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Models/config env propagation: apply `config.env.vars` before implicit provider discovery in models bootstrap so config-scoped credentials are visible to implicit provider resolution paths. (#32295) Thanks @hsiaoa.
- Models/Codex usage labels: infer weekly secondary usage windows from reset cadence when API window seconds are ambiguously reported as 24h, so `openclaw models status` no longer mislabels weekly limits as daily. (#31938) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Gateway/Heartbeat model reload: treat `models.*` and `agents.defaults.model` config updates as heartbeat hot-reload triggers so heartbeat picks up model changes without a full gateway restart. (#32046) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Memory/LanceDB embeddings: forward configured `embedding.dimensions` into OpenAI embeddings requests so vector size and API output dimensions stay aligned when dimensions are explicitly configured. (#32036) Thanks @scotthuang.
- Gateway/Control UI method guard: allow POST requests to non-UI routes to fall through when no base path is configured, and add POST regression coverage for fallthrough and base-path 405 behavior. (#23970) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Browser/CDP status accuracy: require a successful `Browser.getVersion` response over the CDP websocket (not just socket-open) before reporting `cdpReady`, so stale idle command channels are surfaced as unhealthy. (#23427) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Daemon/systemd checks in containers: treat missing `systemctl` invocations (including `spawn systemctl ENOENT`/`EACCES`) as unavailable service state during `is-enabled` checks, preventing container flows from failing with `Gateway service check failed` before install/status handling can continue. (#26089) Thanks @sahilsatralkar and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Node exec approvals: revalidate approval-bound `cwd` identity immediately before execution/forwarding and fail closed with an explicit denial when `cwd` drifts after approval hardening.
- Security audit/skills workspace hardening: add `skills.workspace.symlink_escape` warning in `openclaw security audit` when workspace `skills/**/SKILL.md` resolves outside the workspace root (for example symlink-chain drift), plus docs coverage in the security glossary.
- Security/Node exec approvals: preserve shell/dispatch-wrapper argv semantics during approval hardening so approved wrapper commands (for example `env sh -c ...`) cannot drift into a different runtime command shape, and add regression coverage for both approval-plan generation and approved runtime execution paths. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/fs-safe write hardening: make `writeFileWithinRoot` use same-directory temp writes plus atomic rename, add post-write inode/hardlink revalidation with security warnings on boundary drift, and avoid truncating existing targets when final rename fails.
- Security/Skills archive extraction: unify tar extraction safety checks across tar.gz and tar.bz2 install flows, enforce tar compressed-size limits, and fail closed if tar.bz2 archives change between preflight and extraction to prevent bypasses of entry-type/size guardrails. Thanks @GCXWLP for reporting.
- Security/Prompt spoofing hardening: stop injecting queued runtime events into user-role prompt text, route them through trusted system-prompt context, and neutralize inbound spoof markers like `[System Message]` and line-leading `System:` in untrusted message content. (#30448)
- Sandbox/Docker setup command parsing: accept `agents.*.sandbox.docker.setupCommand` as either a string or a string array, and normalize arrays to newline-delimited shell scripts so multi-step setup commands no longer concatenate without separators. (#31953) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Sandbox/Bootstrap context boundary hardening: reject symlink/hardlink alias bootstrap seed files that resolve outside the source workspace and switch post-compaction `AGENTS.md` context reads to boundary-verified file opens, preventing host file content from being injected via workspace aliasing. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Agents/Sandbox workdir mapping: map container workdir paths (for example `/workspace`) back to the host workspace before sandbox path validation so exec requests keep the intended directory in containerized runs instead of falling back to an unavailable host path. (#31841) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Docker/Sandbox bootstrap hardening: make `OPENCLAW_SANDBOX` opt-in parsing explicit (`1|true|yes|on`), support custom Docker socket paths via `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_SOCKET`, defer docker.sock exposure until sandbox prerequisites pass, and reset/roll back persisted sandbox mode to `off` when setup is skipped or partially fails to avoid stale broken sandbox state. (#29974) Thanks @jamtujest and @vincentkoc.
- Hooks/webhook ACK compatibility: return `200` (instead of `202`) for successful `/hooks/agent` requests so providers that require `200` (for example Forward Email) accept dispatched agent hook deliveries. (#28204) Thanks @AIflow-Labs.
- Feishu/Run channel fallback: prefer `Provider` over `Surface` when inferring queued run `messageProvider` fallback (when `OriginatingChannel` is missing), preventing Feishu turns from being mislabeled as `webchat` in mixed relay metadata contexts. (#31880) Fixes #31859. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Skills/sherpa-onnx-tts: run the `sherpa-onnx-tts` bin under ESM (replace CommonJS `require` imports) and add regression coverage to prevent `require is not defined in ES module scope` startup crashes. (#31965) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Inbound metadata/direct relay context: restore direct-channel conversation metadata blocks for external channels (for example WhatsApp) while preserving webchat-direct suppression, so relay agents recover sender/message identifiers without reintroducing internal webchat metadata noise. (#31969) Fixes #29972. Thanks @Lucenx9.
- Slack/Channel message subscriptions: register explicit `message.channels` and `message.groups` monitor handlers (alongside generic `message`) so channel/group event subscriptions are consumed even when Slack dispatches typed message event names. Fixes #31674.
- Hooks/session-scoped memory context: expose ephemeral `sessionId` in embedded plugin tool contexts and `before_tool_call`/`after_tool_call` hook contexts (including compaction and client-tool wiring) so plugins can isolate per-conversation state across `/new` and `/reset`. Related #31253 and #31304. Thanks @Sid-Qin and @Servo-AIpex.
- Voice-call/Twilio inbound greeting: run answered-call initial notify greeting for Twilio instead of skipping the manager speak path, with regression coverage for both Twilio and Plivo notify flows. (#29121) Thanks @xinhuagu.
- Voice-call/stale call hydration: verify active calls with the provider before loading persisted in-progress calls so stale locally persisted records do not block or misroute new call handling after restarts. (#4325) Thanks @garnetlyx.
- Feishu/File upload filenames: percent-encode non-ASCII/special-character `file_name` values in Feishu multipart uploads so Chinese/symbol-heavy filenames are sent as proper attachments instead of plain text links. (#31179) Thanks @Kay-051.
- Media/MIME channel parity: route Telegram/Signal/iMessage media-kind checks through normalized `kindFromMime` so mixed-case/parameterized MIME values classify consistently across message channels.
- WhatsApp/inbound self-message context: propagate inbound `fromMe` through the web inbox pipeline and annotate direct self messages as `(self)` in envelopes so agents can distinguish owner-authored turns from contact turns. (#32167) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Webchat/stream finalization: persist streamed assistant text when final events omit `message`, while keeping final payload precedence and skipping empty stream buffers to prevent disappearing replies after tool turns. (#31920) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Feishu/Inbound ordering: serialize message handling per chat while preserving cross-chat concurrency to avoid same-chat race drops under bursty inbound traffic. (#31807)
- Feishu/Typing notification suppression: skip typing keepalive reaction re-adds when the indicator is already active, preventing duplicate notification pings from repeated identical emoji adds. (#31580)
- Feishu/Probe failure backoff: cache API and timeout probe failures for one minute per account key while preserving abort-aware probe timeouts, reducing repeated health-check retries during transient credential/network outages. (#29970)
- Feishu/Streaming block fallback: preserve markdown block stream text as final streaming-card content when final payload text is missing, while still suppressing non-card internal block chunk delivery. (#30663)
- Feishu/Bitable API errors: unify Feishu Bitable tool error handling with structured `LarkApiError` responses and consistent API/context attribution across wiki/base metadata, field, and record operations. (#31450)
- Feishu/Missing-scope grant URL fix: rewrite known invalid scope aliases (`contact:contact.base:readonly`) to valid scope names in permission grant links, so remediation URLs open with correct Feishu consent scopes. (#31943)
- BlueBubbles/Message metadata: harden send response ID extraction, include sender identity in DM context, and normalize inbound `message_id` selection to avoid duplicate ID metadata. (#23970) Thanks @tyler6204.
- WebChat/markdown tables: ensure GitHub-flavored markdown table parsing is explicitly enabled at render time and add horizontal overflow handling for wide tables, with regression coverage for table-only and mixed text+table content. (#32365) Thanks @BlueBirdBack.
- Feishu/default account resolution: always honor explicit `channels.feishu.defaultAccount` during outbound account selection (including top-level-credential setups where the preferred id is not present in `accounts`), instead of silently falling back to another account id. (#32253) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Feishu/Sender lookup permissions: suppress user-facing grant prompts for stale non-existent scope errors (`contact:contact.base:readonly`) during best-effort sender-name resolution so inbound messages continue without repeated false permission notices. (#31761)
- Discord/dispatch + Slack formatting: restore parallel outbound dispatch across Discord channels with per-channel queues while preserving in-channel ordering, and run Slack preview/stream update text through mrkdwn normalization for consistent formatting. (#31927) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Feishu/Inbound debounce: debounce rapid same-chat sender bursts into one ordered dispatch turn, skip already-processed retries when composing merged text, and preserve bot-mention intent across merged entries to reduce duplicate or late inbound handling. (#31548)
- Tests/Sandbox + archive portability: use junction-compatible directory-link setup on Windows and explicit file-symlink platform guards in symlink escape tests where unprivileged file symlinks are unavailable, reducing false Windows CI failures while preserving traversal checks on supported paths. (#28747) Thanks @arosstale.
- Browser/Extension re-announce reliability: keep relay state in `connecting` when re-announce forwarding fails and extend debugger re-attach retries after navigation to reduce false attached states and post-nav disconnect loops. (#27630) Thanks @markmusson.
- Browser/Act request compatibility: accept legacy flattened `action="act"` params (`kind/ref/text/...`) in addition to `request={...}` so browser act calls no longer fail with `request required`. (#15120) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- OpenRouter/x-ai compatibility: skip `reasoning.effort` injection for `x-ai/*` models (for example Grok) so OpenRouter requests no longer fail with invalid-arguments errors on unsupported reasoning params. (#32054) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Models/openai-completions developer-role compatibility: force `supportsDeveloperRole=false` for non-native endpoints, treat unparseable `baseUrl` values as non-native, and add regression coverage for empty/malformed baseUrl plus explicit-true override behavior. (#29479) thanks @akramcodez.
- Browser/Profile attach-only override: support `browser.profiles.<name>.attachOnly` (fallback to global `browser.attachOnly`) so loopback proxy profiles can skip local launch/port-ownership checks without forcing attach-only mode for every profile. (#20595) Thanks @unblockedgamesstudio and @vincentkoc.
- Sessions/Lock recovery: detect recycled Linux PIDs by comparing lock-file `starttime` with `/proc/<pid>/stat` starttime, so stale `.jsonl.lock` files are reclaimed immediately in containerized PID-reuse scenarios while preserving compatibility for older lock files. (#26443) Fixes #27252. Thanks @HirokiKobayashi-R and @vincentkoc.
- Cron/isolated delivery target fallback: remove early unresolved-target return so cron delivery can flow through shared outbound target resolution (including per-channel `resolveDefaultTo` fallback) when `delivery.to` is omitted. (#32364) Thanks @hclsys.
- OpenAI media capabilities: include `audio` in the OpenAI provider capability list so audio transcription models are eligible in media-understanding provider selection. (#12717) Thanks @openjay.
- Browser/Managed tab cap: limit loopback managed `openclaw` page tabs to 8 via best-effort cleanup after tab opens to reduce long-running renderer buildup while preserving attach-only and remote profile behavior. (#29724) Thanks @pandego.
- Docker/Image health checks: add Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` that probes gateway `GET /healthz` so container runtimes can mark unhealthy instances without requiring auth credentials in the probe command. (#11478) Thanks @U-C4N and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Node dangerous-command parity: include `sms.send` in default onboarding node `denyCommands`, share onboarding deny defaults with the gateway dangerous-command source of truth, and include `sms.send` in phone-control `/phone arm writes` handling so SMS follows the same break-glass flow as other dangerous node commands. Thanks @zpbrent.
- Pairing/AllowFrom account fallback: handle omitted `accountId` values in `readChannelAllowFromStore` and `readChannelAllowFromStoreSync` as `default`, while preserving legacy unscoped allowFrom merges for default-account flows. Thanks @Sid-Qin and @vincentkoc.
- Browser/Remote CDP ownership checks: skip local-process ownership errors for non-loopback remote CDP profiles when HTTP is reachable but the websocket handshake fails, and surface the remote websocket attach/retry path instead. (#15582) Landed from contributor (#28780) Thanks @stubbi, @bsormagec, @unblockedgamesstudio and @vincentkoc.
- Browser/CDP proxy bypass: force direct loopback agent paths and scoped `NO_PROXY` expansion for localhost CDP HTTP/WS connections when proxy env vars are set, so browser relay/control still works behind global proxy settings. (#31469) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Sessions/idle reset correctness: preserve existing `updatedAt` during inbound metadata-only writes so idle-reset boundaries are not unintentionally refreshed before actual user turns. (#32379) Thanks @romeodiaz.
- Sessions/lock recovery: reclaim orphan legacy same-PID lock files missing `starttime` when no in-process lock ownership exists, avoiding false lock timeouts after PID reuse while preserving active lock safety checks. (#32081) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Sessions/store cache invalidation: reload cached session stores when file size changes within the same mtime tick by keying cache validation on a single file-stat snapshot (`mtimeMs` + `sizeBytes`), with regression coverage for same-tick rewrites. (#32191) Thanks @jalehman.
- Agents/Subagents `sessions_spawn`: reject malformed `agentId` inputs before normalization (for example error-message/path-like strings) to prevent unintended synthetic agent IDs and ghost workspace/session paths; includes strict validation regression coverage. (#31381) Thanks @openperf.
- CLI/installer Node preflight: enforce Node.js `v22.12+` consistently in both `openclaw.mjs` runtime bootstrap and installer active-shell checks, with actionable nvm recovery guidance for mismatched shell PATH/defaults. (#32356) Thanks @jasonhargrove.
- Web UI/config form: support SecretInput string-or-secret-ref unions in map `additionalProperties`, so provider API key fields stay editable instead of being marked unsupported. (#31866) Thanks @ningding97.
- Auto-reply/inline command cleanup: preserve newline structure when stripping inline `/status` and extracting inline slash commands by collapsing only horizontal whitespace, preventing paragraph flattening in multi-line replies. (#32224) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Config/raw redaction safety: preserve non-sensitive literals during raw redaction round-trips, scope SecretRef redaction to secret IDs (not structural fields like `source`/`provider`), and fall back to structured raw redaction when text replacement cannot restore the original config shape. (#32174) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Hooks/runtime stability: keep the internal hook handler registry on a `globalThis` singleton so hook registration/dispatch remains consistent when bundling emits duplicate module copies. (#32292) Thanks @Drickon.
- Hooks/after_tool_call: include embedded session context (`sessionKey`, `agentId`) and fire the hook exactly once per tool execution by removing duplicate adapter-path dispatch in embedded runs. (#32201) Thanks @jbeno, @scoootscooob, @vincentkoc.
- Hooks/tool-call correlation: include `runId` and `toolCallId` in plugin tool hook payloads/context and scope tool start/adjusted-param tracking by run to prevent cross-run collisions in `before_tool_call` and `after_tool_call`. (#32360) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Plugins/install diagnostics: reject legacy plugin package shapes without `openclaw.extensions` and return an explicit upgrade hint with troubleshooting docs for repackaging. (#32055) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Hooks/plugin context parity: ensure `llm_input` hooks in embedded attempts receive the same `trigger` and `channelId`-aware `hookCtx` used by the other hook phases, preserving channel/trigger-scoped plugin behavior. (#28623) Thanks @davidrudduck and @vincentkoc.
- Plugins/hardlink install compatibility: allow bundled plugin manifests and entry files to load when installed via hardlink-based package managers (`pnpm`, `bun`) while keeping hardlink rejection enabled for non-bundled plugin sources. (#32119) Fixes #28175, #28404, #29455. Thanks @markfietje.
- Cron/session reaper reliability: move cron session reaper sweeps into `onTimer` `finally` and keep pruning active even when timer ticks fail early (for example cron store parse failures), preventing stale isolated run sessions from accumulating indefinitely. (#31996) Fixes #31946. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Cron/HEARTBEAT_OK summary leak: suppress fallback main-session enqueue for heartbeat/internal ack summaries in isolated announce mode so `HEARTBEAT_OK` noise never appears in user chat while real summaries still forward. (#32093) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Authentication: classify `permission_error` as `auth_permanent` for profile fallback. (#31324) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Agents/host edit reliability: treat host edit-tool throws as success only when on-disk post-check confirms replacement likely happened (`newText` present and `oldText` absent), preventing false failure reports while avoiding pre-write false positives. (#32383) Thanks @polooooo.
- Plugins/install fallback safety: resolve bare install specs to bundled plugin ids before npm lookup (for example `diffs` -> bundled `@openclaw/diffs`), keep npm fallback limited to true package-not-found errors, and continue rejecting non-plugin npm packages that fail manifest validation. (#32096) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Web UI/inline code copy fidelity: disable forced mid-token wraps on inline `<code>` spans so copied UUID/hash/token strings preserve exact content instead of inserting line-break spaces. (#32346) Thanks @hclsys.
- Restart sentinel formatting: avoid duplicate `Reason:` lines when restart message text already matches `stats.reason`, keeping restart notifications concise for users and downstream parsers. (#32083) Thanks @velamints2.
- Auto-reply/followup queue: avoid stale callback reuse across idle-window restarts by caching the followup runner only when a drain actually starts, preserving enqueue ordering after empty-finalize paths. (#31902) Thanks @Lanfei.
- Agents/tool-result guard: always clear pending tool-call state on interruptions even when synthetic tool results are disabled, preventing orphaned tool-use transcripts that cause follow-up provider request failures. (#32120) Thanks @jnMetaCode.
- Failover/error classification: treat HTTP `529` (provider overloaded, common with Anthropic-compatible APIs) as `rate_limit` so model failover can engage instead of misclassifying the error path. (#31854) Thanks @bugkill3r.
- Logging: use local time for logged timestamps instead of UTC, aligning log output with documented local timezone behavior and avoiding confusion during local diagnostics. (#28434) Thanks @liuy.
- Agents/Subagent announce cleanup: keep completion-message runs pending while descendants settle, add a 30 minute hard-expiry backstop to avoid indefinite pending state, and keep retry bookkeeping resumable across deferred wakes. (#23970) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Secrets/exec resolver timeout defaults: use provider `timeoutMs` as the default inactivity (`noOutputTimeoutMs`) watchdog for exec secret providers, preventing premature no-output kills for resolvers that start producing output after 2s. (#32235) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Auto-reply/reminder guard note suppression: when a turn makes reminder-like commitments but schedules no new cron jobs, suppress the unscheduled-reminder warning note only if an enabled cron already exists for the same session; keep warnings for unrelated sessions, disabled jobs, or unreadable cron store paths. (#32255) Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Cron/isolated announce heartbeat suppression: treat multi-payload runs as skippable when any payload is a heartbeat ack token and no payload has media, preventing internal narration + trailing `HEARTBEAT_OK` from being delivered to users. (#32131) Thanks @adhishthite.
- Cron/store migration: normalize legacy cron jobs with string `schedule` and top-level `command`/`timeout` fields into canonical schedule/payload/session-target shape on load, preventing schedule-error loops on old persisted stores. (#31926) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Tests/Windows backup rotation: skip chmod-only backup permission assertions on Windows while retaining compose/rotation/prune coverage across platforms to avoid false CI failures from Windows non-POSIX mode semantics. (#32286) Thanks @jalehman.
- Tests/Subagent announce: set `OPENCLAW_TEST_FAST=1` before importing `subagent-announce` format suites so module-level fast-mode constants are captured deterministically on Windows CI, preventing timeout flakes in nested completion announce coverage. (#31370) Thanks @zwffff.
- Control UI/markdown recursion fallback: catch markdown parser failures and safely render escaped plain-text fallback instead of crashing the Control UI on pathological markdown history payloads. (#36445, fixes #36213) Thanks @BinHPdev.

## 2026.3.1

### Changes

- OpenAI/Streaming transport: make `openai` Responses WebSocket-first by default (`transport: "auto"` with SSE fallback), add shared OpenAI WS stream/connection runtime wiring with per-session cleanup, and preserve server-side compaction payload mutation (`store` + `context_management`) on the WS path.
- Gateway/Container probes: add built-in HTTP liveness/readiness endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/ready`, `/readyz`) for Docker/Kubernetes health checks, with fallback routing so existing handlers on those paths are not shadowed. (#31272) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Android/Nodes: add `camera.list`, `device.permissions`, `device.health`, and `notifications.actions` (`open`/`dismiss`/`reply`) on Android nodes, plus first-class node-tool actions for the new device/notification commands. (#28260) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord/Thread bindings: replace fixed TTL lifecycle with inactivity (`idleHours`, default 24h) plus optional hard `maxAgeHours` lifecycle controls, and add `/session idle` + `/session max-age` commands for focused thread-bound sessions. (#27845) Thanks @osolmaz.
- Telegram/DM topics: add per-DM `direct` + topic config (allowlists, `dmPolicy`, `skills`, `systemPrompt`, `requireTopic`), route DM topics as distinct inbound/outbound sessions, and enforce topic-aware authorization/debounce for messages, callbacks, commands, and reactions. Landed from contributor PR #30579 by @kesor. Thanks @kesor.
- Android/Gateway capability refresh: add live Android capability integration coverage and node canvas capability refresh wiring, plus runtime hardening for A2UI readiness retries, scoped canvas URL normalization, debug diagnostics JSON, and JavaScript MIME delivery. (#28388) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Nodes parity: add `system.notify`, `photos.latest`, `contacts.search`/`contacts.add`, `calendar.events`/`calendar.add`, and `motion.activity`/`motion.pedometer`, with motion sensor-aware command gating and improved activity sampling reliability. (#29398) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Thinking defaults: set `adaptive` as the default thinking level for Anthropic Claude 4.6 models (including Bedrock Claude 4.6 refs) while keeping other reasoning-capable models at `low` unless explicitly configured.
- Web UI/Cron i18n: localize cron page labels, filters, form help text, and validation/error messaging in English and zh-CN. (#29315) Thanks @BUGKillerKing.
- CLI/Config: add `openclaw config file` to print the active config file path resolved from `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` or the default location. (#26256) thanks @cyb1278588254.
- Feishu/Docx tables + uploads: add `feishu_doc` actions for Docx table creation/cell writing (`create_table`, `write_table_cells`, `create_table_with_values`) and image/file uploads (`upload_image`, `upload_file`) with stricter create/upload error handling for missing `document_id` and placeholder cleanup failures. (#20304) Thanks @xuhao1.
- Feishu/Reactions: add inbound `im.message.reaction.created_v1` handling, route verified reactions through synthetic inbound turns, and harden verification with timeout + fail-closed filtering so non-bot or unverified reactions are dropped. (#16716) Thanks @schumilin.
- Feishu/Chat tooling: add `feishu_chat` tool actions for chat info and member queries, with configurable enablement under `channels.feishu.tools.chat`. (#14674) Thanks @liuweifly.
- Feishu/Doc permissions: support optional owner permission grant fields on `feishu_doc` create and report permission metadata only when the grant call succeeds, with regression coverage for success/failure/omitted-owner paths. (#28295) Thanks @zhoulongchao77.
- Web UI/i18n: add German (`de`) locale support and auto-render language options from supported locale constants in Overview settings. (#28495) thanks @dsantoreis.
- Tools/Diffs: add a new optional `diffs` plugin tool for read-only diff rendering from before/after text or unified patches, with gateway viewer URLs for canvas and PNG image output. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Memory/LanceDB: support custom OpenAI `baseUrl` and embedding dimensions for LanceDB memory. (#17874) Thanks @rish2jain and @vincentkoc.
- ACP/ACPX streaming: pin ACPX plugin support to `0.1.15`, add configurable ACPX command/version probing, and streamline ACP stream delivery (`final_only` default + reduced tool-event noise) with matching runtime and test updates. (#30036) Thanks @osolmaz.
- Shell env markers: set `OPENCLAW_SHELL` across shell-like runtimes (`exec`, `acp`, `acp-client`, `tui-local`) so shell startup/config rules can target OpenClaw contexts consistently, and document the markers in env/exec/acp/TUI docs. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Cron/Heartbeat light bootstrap context: add opt-in lightweight bootstrap mode for automation runs (`--light-context` for cron agent turns and `agents.*.heartbeat.lightContext` for heartbeat), keeping only `HEARTBEAT.md` for heartbeat runs and skipping bootstrap-file injection for cron lightweight runs. (#26064) Thanks @jose-velez.
- OpenAI/WebSocket warm-up: add optional OpenAI Responses WebSocket warm-up (`response.create` with `generate:false`), enable it by default for `openai/*`, and expose `params.openaiWsWarmup` for per-model enable/disable control.
- Agents/Subagents runtime events: replace ad-hoc subagent completion system-message handoff with typed internal completion events (`task_completion`) that are rendered consistently across direct and queued announce paths, with gateway/CLI plumbing for structured `internalEvents`.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Node exec approval payloads now require `systemRunPlan`. `host=node` approval requests without that plan are rejected.
- **BREAKING:** Node `system.run` execution now pins path-token commands to the canonical executable path (`realpath`) in both allowlist and approval execution flows. Integrations/tests that asserted token-form argv (for example `tr`) must now accept canonical paths (for example `/usr/bin/tr`).

### Fixes

- Feishu/Streaming card text fidelity: merge throttled/fragmented partial updates without dropping content and avoid newline injection when stitching chunk-style deltas so card-stream output matches final reply text. (#29616) Thanks @HaoHuaqing.
- Security/Feishu webhook ingress: bound unauthenticated webhook rate-limit state with stale-window pruning and a hard key cap to prevent unbounded pre-auth memory growth from rotating source keys. (#26050) Thanks @bmendonca3.

- Web tools/RFC2544 fake-IP compatibility: allow RFC2544 benchmark range (`198.18.0.0/15`) for trusted web-tool fetch endpoints so proxy fake-IP networking modes do not trigger false SSRF blocks. Landed from contributor PR #31176 by @sunkinux. Thanks @sunkinux.
- Feishu/Sessions announce group targets: normalize `group:` and `channel:` Feishu targets to `chat_id` routing so `sessions_send` announce delivery no longer sends group chat IDs via `user_id` API params. Fixes #31426.
- Windows/Plugin install: avoid `spawn EINVAL` on Windows npm/npx invocations by resolving to `node` + npm CLI scripts instead of spawning `.cmd` directly. Landed from contributor PR #31147 by @codertony. Thanks @codertony.
- Web UI/Cron: include configured agent model defaults/fallbacks in cron model suggestions so scheduled-job model autocomplete reflects configured models. (#29709) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Cron/Delivery: disable the agent messaging tool when `delivery.mode` is `"none"` so cron output is not sent to Telegram or other channels. (#21808) Thanks @lailoo.
- CLI/Cron: clarify `cron list` output by renaming `Agent` to `Agent ID` and adding a `Model` column for isolated agent-turn jobs. (#26259) Thanks @openperf.
- Gateway/Control UI origins: honor `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins: ["*"]` wildcard entries (including trimmed values) and lock behavior with regression tests. Landed from contributor PR #31058 by @byungsker. Thanks @byungsker.
- Agents/Sessions list transcript paths: handle missing/non-string/relative `sessions.list.path` values and per-agent `{agentId}` templates when deriving `transcriptPath`, so cross-agent session listings resolve to concrete agent session files instead of workspace-relative paths. (#24775) Thanks @martinfrancois.
- Gateway/Control UI CSP: allow required Google Fonts origins in Control UI CSP. (#29279) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- CLI/Install: add an npm-link fallback to fix CLI startup `Permission denied` failures (`exit 127`) on affected installs. (#17151) Thanks @sskyu and @vincentkoc.
- Plugins/NPM spec install: fix npm-spec plugin installs when `npm pack` output is empty by detecting newly created `.tgz` archives in the pack directory. (#21039) Thanks @graysurf and @vincentkoc.
- Plugins/Install: clear stale install errors when an npm package is not found so follow-up install attempts report current state correctly. (#25073) Thanks @dalefrieswthat.
- Gateway/macOS supervised restart: actively `launchctl kickstart -k` during intentional supervised restarts to bypass LaunchAgent `ThrottleInterval` delays, and fall back to in-process restart when kickstart fails. Landed from contributor PR #29078 by @cathrynlavery. Thanks @cathrynlavery.
- Sessions/Internal routing: preserve established external `lastTo`/`lastChannel` routes for internal/non-deliverable turns, with added coverage for no-fallback internal routing behavior. Landed from contributor PR #30941 by @graysurf. Thanks @graysurf.
- Auto-reply/NO_REPLY: strip `NO_REPLY` token from mixed-content messages instead of leaking raw control text to end users. Landed from contributor PR #31080 by @scoootscooob. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Inbound metadata/Multi-account routing: include `account_id` in trusted inbound metadata so multi-account channel sessions can reliably disambiguate the receiving account in prompt context. Landed from contributor PR #30984 by @Stxle2. Thanks @Stxle2.
- Cron/Delivery mode none: send explicit `delivery: { mode: "none" }` from cron editor for both add and update flows so previous announce delivery is actually cleared. Landed from contributor PR #31145 by @byungsker. Thanks @byungsker.
- Cron editor viewport: make the sticky cron edit form independently scrollable with viewport-bounded height so lower fields/actions are reachable on shorter screens. Landed from contributor PR #31133 by @Sid-Qin. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Agents/Thinking fallback: when providers reject unsupported thinking levels without enumerating alternatives, retry with `think=off` to avoid hard failure during model/provider fallback chains. Landed from contributor PR #31002 by @yfge. Thanks @yfge.
- Agents/Failover reason classification: avoid false rate-limit classification from incidental `tpm` substrings by matching TPM as a standalone token/phrase and keeping auth-context errors on the auth path. Landed from contributor PR #31007 by @HOYALIM. Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Gateway/WS: close repeated post-handshake `unauthorized role:*` request floods per connection and sample duplicate rejection logs, preventing a single misbehaving client from degrading gateway responsiveness. (#20168) Thanks @acy103, @vibecodooor, and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Auth: improve device-auth v2 migration diagnostics so operators get clearer guidance when legacy clients connect. (#28305) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- CLI/Ollama config: allow `config set` for Ollama `apiKey` without predeclared provider config. (#29299) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Ollama: demote empty-discovery logging from `warn` to `debug` to reduce noisy warnings in normal edge-case discovery flows. (#26379) Thanks @byungsker.
- Sandbox/Browser Docker: pass `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX=1` to sandbox browser containers and bump sandbox browser security hash epoch so existing containers are recreated and pick up the env on upgrade. (#29879) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Tools/Edit workspace boundary errors: preserve the real `Path escapes workspace root` failure path instead of surfacing a misleading access/file-not-found error when editing outside workspace roots. Landed from contributor PR #31015 by @haosenwang1018. Thanks @haosenwang1018.
- Browser/Open & navigate: accept `url` as an alias parameter for `open` and `navigate`. (#29260) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Sandbox/mkdirp boundary checks: allow directory-safe boundary validation for existing in-boundary subdirectories, preventing false `cannot create directories` failures in sandbox write mode. (#30610) Thanks @glitch418x.
- Android/Nodes reliability: reject `facing=both` when `deviceId` is set to avoid mislabeled duplicate captures, allow notification `open`/`reply` on non-clearable entries while still gating dismiss, trigger listener rebind before notification actions, and scale invoke-result ack timeout to invoke budget for large clip payloads. (#28260) Thanks @obviyus.
- LINE/Voice transcription: classify M4A voice media as `audio/mp4` (not `video/mp4`) by checking the MPEG-4 `ftyp` major brand (`M4A ` / `M4B `), restoring voice transcription for LINE voice messages. Landed from contributor PR #31151 by @scoootscooob. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Slack/Announce target account routing: enable session-backed announce-target lookup for Slack so multi-account announces resolve the correct `accountId` instead of defaulting to bot-token context. Landed from contributor PR #31028 by @taw0002. Thanks @taw0002.
- Android/Voice screen TTS: stream assistant speech via ElevenLabs WebSocket in Talk Mode, stop cleanly on speaker mute/barge-in, and ignore stale out-of-order stream events. (#29521) Thanks @gregmousseau.
- Android/Photos permissions: declare Android 14+ selected-photo access permission (`READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED`) and align Android permission/settings paths with current minSdk behavior for more reliable permission state handling.
- Feishu/Reply media attachments: send Feishu reply `mediaUrl`/`mediaUrls` payloads as attachments alongside text/streamed replies in the reply dispatcher, including legacy fallback when `mediaUrls` is empty. (#28959) Thanks @icesword0760.
- Slack/User-token resolution: normalize Slack account user-token sourcing through resolved account metadata (`SLACK_USER_TOKEN` env + config) so monitor reads, Slack actions, directory lookups, onboarding allow-from resolution, and capabilities probing consistently use the effective user token. (#28103) Thanks @chilu18.
- Feishu/Outbound session routing: stop assuming bare `oc_` identifiers are always group chats, honor explicit `dm:`/`group:` prefixes for `oc_` chat IDs, and default ambiguous bare `oc_` targets to direct routing to avoid DM session misclassification. (#10407) Thanks @Bermudarat.
- Feishu/Group session routing: add configurable group session scopes (`group`, `group_sender`, `group_topic`, `group_topic_sender`) with legacy `topicSessionMode=enabled` compatibility so Feishu group conversations can isolate sessions by sender/topic as configured. (#17798) Thanks @yfge.
- Feishu/Reply-in-thread routing: add `replyInThread` config (`disabled|enabled`) for group replies, propagate `reply_in_thread` across text/card/media/streaming sends, and align topic-scoped session routing so newly created reply threads stay on the same session root. (#27325) Thanks @kcinzgg.
- Feishu/Probe status caching: cache successful `probeFeishu()` bot-info results for 10 minutes (bounded cache with per-account keying) to reduce repeated status/onboarding probe API calls, while bypassing cache for failures and exceptions. (#28907) Thanks @hou-rong.
- Feishu/Opus media send type: send `.opus` attachments with `msg_type: "audio"` (instead of `"media"`) so Feishu voice messages deliver correctly while `.mp4` remains `msg_type: "media"` and documents remain `msg_type: "file"`. (#28269) Thanks @PinoHouse.
- Feishu/Mobile video media type: treat inbound `message_type: "media"` as video-equivalent for media key extraction, placeholder inference, and media download resolution so mobile-app video sends ingest correctly. (#25502) Thanks @4ier.
- Feishu/Inbound sender fallback: fall back to `sender_id.user_id` when `sender_id.open_id` is missing on inbound events, and use ID-type-aware sender lookup so mobile-delivered messages keep stable sender identity/routing. (#26703) Thanks @NewdlDewdl.
- Feishu/Reply context metadata: include inbound `parent_id` and `root_id` as `ReplyToId`/`RootMessageId` in inbound context, and parse interactive-card quote bodies into readable text when fetching replied messages. (#18529) Thanks @qiangu.
- Feishu/Post embedded media: extract `media` tags from inbound rich-text (`post`) messages and download embedded video/audio files alongside existing embedded-image handling, with regression coverage. (#21786) Thanks @laopuhuluwa.
- Feishu/Local media sends: propagate `mediaLocalRoots` through Feishu outbound media sending into `loadWebMedia` so local path attachments work with post-CVE local-root enforcement. (#27884) Thanks @joelnishanth.
- Feishu/Group wildcard policy fallback: honor `channels.feishu.groups["*"]` when no explicit group match exists so unmatched groups inherit wildcard reply-policy settings instead of falling back to global defaults. (#29456) Thanks @WaynePika.
- Feishu/Inbound media regression coverage: add explicit tests for message resource type mapping (`image` stays `image`, non-image maps to `file`) to prevent reintroducing unsupported Feishu `type=audio` fetches. (#16311, #8746) Thanks @Yaxuan42.
- TTS/Voice bubbles: use opus output and enable `audioAsVoice` routing for Feishu and WhatsApp (in addition to Telegram) so supported channels receive voice-bubble playback instead of file-style audio attachments. (#27366) Thanks @smthfoxy.
- Telegram/Reply media context: include replied media files in inbound context when replying to media, defer reply-media downloads to debounce flush, gate reply-media fetch behind DM authorization, and preserve replied media when non-vision sticker fallback runs (including cached-sticker paths). (#28488) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Nodes notification wake flow: enable Android `system.notify` default allowlist, emit `notifications.changed` events for posted/removed notifications (excluding OpenClaw app-owned notifications), canonicalize notification session keys before enqueue/wake routing, and skip heartbeat wakes when consecutive notification summaries dedupe. (#29440) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Voice fallback reply chunking: apply reply reference, quote text, and inline buttons only to the first fallback text chunk when voice delivery is blocked, preventing over-quoted multi-chunk replies. Landed from contributor PR #31067 by @xdanger. Thanks @xdanger.
- Feishu/Multi-account + reply reliability: add `channels.feishu.defaultAccount` outbound routing support with schema validation, keep quoted-message extraction text-first (post/interactive/file placeholders instead of raw JSON), route Feishu video sends as `msg_type: "file"`, and avoid websocket event blocking by using non-blocking event handling in monitor dispatch. Landed from contributor PRs #29610, #30432, #30331, and #29501. Thanks @hclsys, @bmendonca3, @patrick-yingxi-pan, and @zwffff.
- Feishu/Inbound rich-text parsing: preserve `share_chat` payload summaries when available and add explicit parsing for rich-text `code`/`code_block`/`pre` tags so forwarded and code-heavy messages keep useful context in agent input. (#28591) Thanks @kevinWangSheng.
- Feishu/Post markdown parsing: parse rich-text `post` payloads through a shared markdown-aware parser with locale-wrapper support, preserved mention/image metadata extraction, and inline/fenced code fidelity for agent input rendering. (#12755) Thanks @WilsonLiu95.
- Telegram/Outbound chunking: route oversize splitting through the shared outbound pipeline (including subagents), retry Telegram sends when escaped HTML exceeds limits, and preserve boundary whitespace when retry re-splitting rendered chunks so plain-text/transcript fidelity is retained. (#29342, #27317; follow-up to #27461) Thanks @obviyus.
- Slack/Native commands: register Slack native status as `/agentstatus` (Slack-reserved `/status`) so manifest slash command registration stays valid while text `/status` still works. Landed from contributor PR #29032 by @maloqab. Thanks @maloqab.
- Android/Camera clip: remove `camera.clip` HTTP-upload fallback to base64 so clip transport is deterministic and fail-loud, and reject non-positive `maxWidth` values so invalid inputs fall back to the safe resize default. (#28229) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Gateway canvas capability refresh: send `node.canvas.capability.refresh` with object `params` (`{}`) from Android node runtime so gateway object-schema validation accepts refresh retries and A2UI host recovery works after scoped capability expiry. (#28413) Thanks @obviyus.
- Onboarding/Custom providers: improve verification reliability for slower local endpoints (for example Ollama) during setup. (#27380) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Daemon/macOS TLS certs: default LaunchAgent service env `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` (while preserving explicit overrides) so HTTPS clients no longer fail with local-issuer errors under launchd. (#27915) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Daemon/Linux systemd user-bus fallback: when `systemctl --user` cannot reach the user bus due missing session env, fall back to `systemctl --machine <user>@ --user` so daemon checks/install continue in headless SSH/server sessions. (#34884) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Linux restart health: reduce false `openclaw gateway restart` timeouts by falling back to `ss -ltnp` when `lsof` is missing, confirming ambiguous busy-port cases via local gateway probe, and targeting the original `SUDO_USER` systemd user scope for restart commands. (#34874) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Discord/Components wildcard handlers: use distinct internal registration sentinel IDs and parse those sentinels as wildcard keys so select/user/role/channel/mentionable/modal interactions are not dropped by raw customId dedupe paths. Landed from contributor PR #29459 by @Sid-Qin. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Feishu/Reaction notifications: add `channels.feishu.reactionNotifications` (`off | own | all`, default `own`) so operators can disable reaction ingress or allow all verified reaction events (not only bot-authored message reactions). (#28529) Thanks @cowboy129.
- Feishu/Typing backoff: re-throw Feishu typing add/remove rate-limit and quota errors (`429`, `99991400`, `99991403`) and detect SDK non-throwing backoff responses so the typing keepalive circuit breaker can stop retries instead of looping indefinitely. (#28494) Thanks @guoqunabc.
- Feishu/Zalo runtime logging: replace direct `console.log/error` usage in Feishu typing-indicator paths and Zalo monitor paths with runtime-gated logger calls so verbosity controls are respected while preserving typing backoff behavior. (#18841) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Feishu/Group sender allowlist fallback: add global `channels.feishu.groupSenderAllowFrom` sender authorization for group chats, with per-group `groups.<id>.allowFrom` precedence and regression coverage for allow/block/precedence behavior. (#29174) Thanks @1MoreBuild.
- Feishu/Docx append/write ordering: insert converted Docx blocks sequentially (single-block creates) so Feishu append/write preserves markdown block order instead of returning shuffled sections in asynchronous batch inserts. (#26172, #26022) Thanks @echoVic.
- Feishu/Docx convert fallback chunking: recursively split oversized markdown chunks (including long no-heading sections) when `document.convert` hits content limits, while keeping fenced-code-aware split boundaries whenever possible. (#14402) Thanks @lml2468.
- Feishu/API quota controls: add `typingIndicator` and `resolveSenderNames` config flags (top-level and per-account) so operators can disable typing reactions and sender-name lookup requests while keeping default behavior unchanged. (#10513) Thanks @BigUncle.
- Feishu/System preview prompt leakage: stop enqueuing inbound Feishu message previews as system events so user preview text is not injected into later turns as trusted `System:` context. Landed from contributor PR #31209 by @stakeswky. Thanks @stakeswky.
- Feishu/Typing replay suppression: skip typing indicators for stale replayed inbound messages after compaction using message-age checks with second/millisecond timestamp normalization, preventing old-message reaction floods while preserving typing for fresh messages. Landed from contributor PR #30709 by @arkyu2077. Thanks @arkyu2077.
- Control UI/Debug log layout: render Debug Event Log payloads at full width to prevent payload JSON from being squeezed into a narrow side column. Landed from contributor PR #30978 by @stozo04. Thanks @stozo04.
- Install/npm: fix npm global install deprecation warnings. (#28318) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Update/Global npm: fallback to `--omit=optional` when global `npm update` fails so optional dependency install failures no longer abort update flows. (#24896) Thanks @xinhuagu and @vincentkoc.
- Model directives/Auth profiles: split `/model` profile suffixes at the first `@` after the last slash so email-based auth profile IDs (for example OAuth profile IDs) resolve correctly. Landed from contributor PR #30932 by @haosenwang1018. Thanks @haosenwang1018.
- Ollama/Embedded runner base URL precedence: prioritize configured provider `baseUrl` over model defaults for embedded Ollama runs so Docker and remote-host setups avoid localhost fetch failures. (#30964) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Ollama/Autodiscovery: harden autodiscovery and warning behavior. (#29201) Thanks @marcodelpin and @vincentkoc.
- Ollama/Context window: unify context window handling across discovery, merge, and OpenAI-compatible transport paths. (#29205) Thanks @Sid-Qin, @jimmielightner, and @vincentkoc.
- fix(model): preserve reasoning in provider fallback resolution. (#29285) Fixes #25636. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Docker/Image permissions: normalize `/app/extensions`, `/app/.agent`, and `/app/.agents` to directory mode `755` and file mode `644` during image build so plugin discovery does not block inherited world-writable paths. (#30191) Fixes #30139. Thanks @edincampara.
- OpenAI Responses/Compaction: rewrite and unify the OpenAI Responses store patches to treat empty `baseUrl` as non-direct, honor `compat.supportsStore=false`, and auto-inject server-side compaction `context_management` for compatible direct OpenAI models (with per-model opt-out/threshold overrides). Landed from contributor PRs #16930 (@OiPunk), #22441 (@EdwardWu7), and #25088 (@MoerAI). Thanks @OiPunk, @EdwardWu7, and @MoerAI.
- Agents/Compaction safeguard: preserve recent turns verbatim with stable user/assistant pairing, keep multimodal and tool-result hints in preserved tails, and avoid empty-history fallback text in compacted output. (#25554) thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Usage normalization: clamp negative prompt/input token values to zero (including `prompt_tokens` alias inputs) so `/usage` and TUI usage displays cannot show nonsensical negative counts. Landed from contributor PR #31211 by @scoootscooob. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Secrets/Auth profiles: normalize inline SecretRef `token`/`key` values to canonical `tokenRef`/`keyRef` before persistence, and keep explicit `keyRef` precedence when inline refs are also present. Landed from contributor PR #31047 by @minupla. Thanks @minupla.
- Codex/Usage window: label weekly usage window as `Week` instead of `Day`. (#26267) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Signal/Sync message null-handling: treat `syncMessage` presence (including `null`) as sync envelope traffic so replayed sentTranscript payloads cannot bypass loop guards after daemon restart. Landed from contributor PR #31138 by @Sid-Qin. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Infra/fs-safe: sanitize directory-read failures so raw `EISDIR` text never leaks to messaging surfaces, with regression tests for both root-scoped and direct safe reads. Landed from contributor PR #31205 by @polooooo. Thanks @polooooo.

## Unreleased

### Changes

- Models/OpenAI forward compat: add support for `openai/gpt-5.4`, `openai/gpt-5.4-pro`, and `openai-codex/gpt-5.4`, including direct OpenAI Responses `serviceTier` passthrough safeguards for valid values. (#36590) Thanks @dorukardahan.
- Android/Play package ID: rename the Android app package to `ai.openclaw.app`, including matching benchmark and Android tooling references for Play publishing. (#38712) Thanks @obviyus.

### Fixes

- Gateway/macOS restart: remove self-issued `launchctl kickstart -k` from launchd supervised restart path to prevent race with launchd's async bootout state machine that permanently unloads the LaunchAgent. With `ThrottleInterval=1` (current default), `exit(0)` + `KeepAlive=true` restarts the service within ~1s without the race condition. (#39760) Landed from contributor PR #39763 by @daymade. Thanks @daymade.
- Plugin SDK/bundled subpath contracts: add regression coverage for newly routed bundled-plugin SDK exports so BlueBubbles, Mattermost, Nextcloud Talk, and Twitch subpath symbols stay pinned during future plugin-sdk cleanup. (#39638)
- Exec/system.run env sanitization: block dangerous override-only env pivots such as `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, editor/pager hooks, and `GIT_CONFIG_` / `NPM_CONFIG_` override prefixes so allowlisted tools cannot smuggle helper command execution through subprocess environment overrides. Thanks @tdjackey and @SnailSploit for reporting.
- Network/fetch guard redirect auth stripping: switch cross-origin redirect handling in `fetchWithSsrFGuard` from a narrow sensitive-header denylist to a safe-header allowlist so custom auth headers like `X-Api-Key` and `Private-Token` no longer leak on origin changes. Thanks @Rickidevs for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox media reads: eliminate sandbox media TOCTOU symlink-retarget escapes by enforcing root-scoped boundary-safe reads at attachment/image load time and consolidating shared safe-read helpers across sandbox media callsites. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox media staging: block destination symlink escapes in `stageSandboxMedia` by replacing direct destination copies with root-scoped safe writes for both local and SCP-staged attachments, preventing out-of-workspace file overwrite through `media/inbound` alias traversal. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.3.2`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox fs bridge: harden sandbox `readFile`, `mkdirp`, `remove`, and `rename` operations by pinning reads to boundary-opened file descriptors and anchoring filesystem changes to verified canonical parent directories plus basenames instead of passing mutable full path strings to `mkdir -p`, `rm`, and `mv`, reducing TOCTOU race exposure in sandbox file operations. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Workspace safe writes: harden `writeFileWithinRoot` against symlink-retarget TOCTOU races by opening existing files without truncation, creating missing files with exclusive create, deferring truncation until post-open identity+boundary validation, and removing out-of-root create artifacts on blocked races; added regression tests for truncate/create race paths. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.3.2`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Subagents sandbox inheritance: block sandboxed sessions from spawning cross-agent subagents that would run unsandboxed, preventing runtime sandbox downgrade via `sessions_spawn agentId`. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Browser/Security: fail closed on browser-control auth bootstrap errors; if auto-auth setup fails and no explicit token/password exists, browser control server startup now aborts instead of starting unauthenticated. This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @ijxpwastaken.
- Security/ACPX Windows spawn hardening: resolve `.cmd/.bat` wrappers via PATH/PATHEXT and execute unwrapped Node/EXE entrypoints without shell parsing when possible, and enable strict fail-closed handling (`strictWindowsCmdWrapper`) by default for unresolvable wrappers on Windows (with explicit opt-out for compatibility). This ships in the next npm release. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Web search citation redirects: enforce strict SSRF defaults for Gemini citation redirect resolution so redirects to localhost/private/internal targets are blocked. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Node metadata policy: harden node platform classification against Unicode confusables and switch unknown platform defaults to a conservative allowlist that excludes `system.run`/`system.which` unless explicitly allowlisted, preventing metadata canonicalization drift from broadening node command permissions. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Skills: harden skill installer metadata parsing by rejecting unsafe installer specs (brew/node/go/uv/download) and constrain plugin-declared skill directories to the plugin root (including symlink-escape checks), with regression coverage.
- Sandbox/noVNC hardening: increase observer password entropy, shorten observer token lifetime, and replace noVNC token redirect with a bootstrap page that keeps credentials out of `Location` query strings and adds strict no-cache/no-referrer headers.
- Security/Logging utility hardening: remove `eval`-based command execution from `scripts/clawlog.sh`, switch to argv-safe command construction, and escape predicate literals for user-supplied search/category filters to block local command/predicate injection paths.
- Slack/Security ingress mismatch guard: drop slash-command and interaction payloads when app/team identifiers do not match the active Slack account context (including nested `team.id` interaction payloads), preventing cross-app or cross-workspace payload injection into system-event handling. (#29091) Thanks @Solvely-Colin.
- Security/Inbound metadata stripping: tighten sentinel matching and JSON-fence validation for inbound metadata stripping so user-authored lookalike lines no longer trigger unintended metadata removal.
- Security/External content marker folding: expand Unicode angle-bracket homoglyph normalization in marker sanitization so additional guillemet, double-angle, tortoise-shell, flattened-parenthesis, and ornamental variants are folded before boundary replacement. (#30951) Thanks @benediktjohannes.
- Security/Zalo webhook memory hardening: bound webhook security tracking state and normalize security keying to matched webhook paths (excluding attacker query-string churn) to prevent unauthenticated memory growth pressure on reachable webhook endpoints. Thanks @Somet2mes.
- Security/Audit: flag `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins=["*"]` as a high-risk configuration (severity based on bind exposure), and add a Feishu doc-tool warning that `owner_open_id` on `feishu_doc` create can grant document permissions.
- Hooks/auth throttling: reject non-`POST` `/hooks/*` requests before auth-failure accounting so unsupported methods can no longer burn the hook auth lockout budget and block legitimate webhook delivery. Thanks @JNX03 for reporting.
- Feishu/Doc create permissions: remove caller-controlled owner fields from `feishu_doc` create and bind optional grant behavior to trusted Feishu requester context (`grant_to_requester`), preventing principal selection via tool arguments. (#31184) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Dashboard/macOS auth handling: switch the macOS “Open Dashboard” flow from query-string token injection to URL fragments, stop persisting Control UI gateway tokens in browser localStorage, and scrub legacy stored tokens on load. Thanks @JNX03 for reporting.
- Gateway/Plugin HTTP auth hardening: require gateway auth for protected plugin paths and explicit `registerHttpRoute` paths (while preserving wildcard-handler behavior for signature-auth webhooks), and run plugin handlers after built-in handlers for deterministic route precedence. Landed from contributor PR #29198. Thanks @Mariana-Codebase.
- Gateway/Upgrade migration for Control UI origins: seed `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` on startup for legacy non-loopback configs (`lan`/`tailnet`/`custom`) when origins are missing or blank, preventing post-upgrade crash loops while preserving explicit existing policy. Landed from contributor PR #29394. Thanks @synchronic1.
- Gateway/Config patch guard: reject `config.patch` updates that set non-loopback `gateway.bind` while `gateway.tailscale.mode` is `serve`/`funnel`, preventing restart crash loops from invalid bind/tailscale combinations. Landed from contributor PR #30910. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Gateway/Tailscale onboarding origin allowlist: auto-add the detected Tailnet HTTPS origin during interactive configure/onboarding flows (including IPv6-safe origin formatting and binary-path reuse), so Tailscale serve/funnel Control UI access works without manual `allowedOrigins` edits. Landed from contributor PR #26157. Thanks @stakeswky.
- Web UI/Assistant text: strip internal `<relevant-memories>...</relevant-memories>` scaffolding from rendered assistant messages (while preserving code-fence literals), preventing memory-context leakage in chat output for models that echo internal blocks. (#29851) Thanks @Valkster70.
- Dashboard/Sessions: allow authenticated Control UI clients to delete and patch sessions while still blocking regular webchat clients from session mutation RPCs, fixing Dashboard session delete failures. (#21264) Thanks @jskoiz.
- Web UI/Control UI WebSocket defaults: include normalized `gateway.controlUi.basePath` (or inferred nested route base path) in the default `gatewayUrl` so first-load dashboard connections work behind path-based reverse proxies. (#30228) Thanks @gittb.
- Gateway/Control UI API routing: when `gateway.controlUi.basePath` is unset (default), stop serving Control UI SPA HTML for `/api` and `/api/*` so API paths fall through to normal gateway handlers/404 responses instead of `index.html`. (#30333) Fixes #30295. thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Node host/service auth env: include `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in `openclaw node install` service environments (with `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` compatibility fallback) so installed node services keep remote gateway token auth across restart/reboot. Fixes #31041. Thanks @OneStepAt4time for reporting, @byungsker, @liuxiaopai-ai, and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Control UI origins: support wildcard `"*"` in `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` for trusted remote access setups. Landed from contributor PR #31088. Thanks @frankekn.
- Gateway/Cron auditability: add gateway info logs for successful cron create, update, and remove operations. (#25090) Thanks @MoerAI.
- Control UI/Cron editor: include `{ mode: "none" }` in `cron.update` patches when editing an existing job and selecting “Result delivery = None (internal)”, so saved jobs no longer keep stale announce delivery mode. Fixes #31075.
- Feishu/Multi-account + reply reliability: add `channels.feishu.defaultAccount` outbound routing support with schema validation, prevent inbound preview text from leaking into prompt system events, keep quoted-message extraction text-first (post/interactive/file placeholders instead of raw JSON), route Feishu video sends as `msg_type: "file"`, and avoid websocket event blocking by using non-blocking event handling in monitor dispatch. Landed from contributor PRs #31209, #29610, #30432, #30331, and #29501. Thanks @stakeswky, @hclsys, @bmendonca3, @patrick-yingxi-pan, and @zwffff.
- Feishu/Target routing + replies + dedupe: normalize provider-prefixed targets (`feishu:`/`lark:`), prefer configured `channels.feishu.defaultAccount` for tool execution, honor Feishu outbound `renderMode` in adapter text/caption sends, fall back to normal send when reply targets are withdrawn/deleted, and add synchronous in-memory dedupe guard for concurrent duplicate inbound events. Landed from contributor PRs #30428, #30438, #29958, #30444, and #29463. Thanks @bmendonca3 and @Yaxuan42.
- Channels/Multi-account default routing: add optional `channels.<channel>.defaultAccount` default-selection support across message channels so omitted `accountId` routes to an explicit configured account instead of relying on implicit first-entry ordering (fallback behavior unchanged when unset).
- Telegram/Multi-account fallback isolation: fail closed for non-default Telegram accounts when route resolution falls back to `matchedBy=default`, preventing cross-account DM/session contamination without explicit account bindings. (#31110)
- Telegram/DM topic session isolation: scope DM topic thread session keys by chat ID (`<chatId>:<threadId>`) and parse scoped thread IDs in outbound recovery so parallel DMs cannot collide on shared topic IDs. Landed from contributor PR #31064. Thanks @0xble.
- Telegram/Multi-account group isolation: prevent channel-level `groups` config from leaking across Telegram accounts in multi-account setups, avoiding cross-account group routing drops. Landed from contributor PR #30677. Thanks @YUJIE2002.
- Telegram/Group allowlist ordering: evaluate chat allowlist before sender allowlist enforcement so explicitly allowlisted groups are not fail-closed by empty sender allowlists. Landed from contributor PR #30680. Thanks @openperf.
- Telegram/Empty final replies: skip outbound send for null/undefined final text payloads without media so Telegram typing indicators do not linger on `text must be non-empty` errors, with added regression coverage for undefined final payload dispatch. Landed from contributor PRs #30969 and #30746. Thanks @haosenwang1018 and @rylena.
- Telegram/Voice caption overflow fallback: recover from `sendVoice` caption length errors by re-sending voice without caption and delivering text separately so replies are not lost. Landed from contributor PR #31131. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Telegram/Reply `first` chunking: apply `replyToMode: "first"` reply targets only to the first Telegram text/media/fallback chunk, avoiding multi-chunk over-quoting in split replies. Landed from contributor PR #31077. Thanks @scoootscooob.
- Telegram/Proxy dispatcher preservation: preserve proxy-aware global undici dispatcher behavior in Telegram network workarounds so proxy-backed Telegram + model traffic is not broken by dispatcher replacement. Landed from contributor PR #30367. Thanks @Phineas1500.
- Telegram/Media fetch IPv4 fallback: retry Telegram media fetches once with IPv4-first dispatcher settings when dual-stack connect errors (`ETIMEDOUT`/`ENETUNREACH`/`EHOSTUNREACH`) occur, improving reliability on broken IPv6 routes. Landed from contributor PR #30554. Thanks @bosuksh.
- Telegram/Restart polling teardown: stop the Telegram bot instance when a polling cycle exits so in-process SIGUSR1 restarts fully tear down old long-poll loops before restart, reducing post-restart `getUpdates` 409 conflict storms. Fixes #31107. Landed from contributor PR #31141. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Google Chat/Thread replies: set `messageReplyOption=REPLY_MESSAGE_FALLBACK_TO_NEW_THREAD` on threaded sends so replies attach to existing threads instead of silently failing thread placement. Landed from contributor PR #30965. Thanks @novan.
- Mattermost/Private channel policy routing: map Mattermost private channel type `P` to group chat type so `groupPolicy`/`groupAllowFrom` gates apply correctly instead of being treated as open public channels. Landed from contributor PR #30891. Thanks @BlueBirdBack.
- Discord/Agent component interactions: accept Components v2 `cid` payloads alongside legacy `componentId`, and safely decode percent-encoded IDs without throwing on malformed `%` sequences. Landed from contributor PR #29013. Thanks @Jacky1n7.
- Discord/Inbound media fallback: preserve attachment and sticker metadata when Discord CDN fetch/save fails by keeping URL-based media entries in context, with regression coverage for save failures and mixed success/failure ordering. Landed from contributor PR #28906. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Matrix/Directory room IDs: preserve original room-ID casing for direct `!roomId` group lookups (without `:server`) so allowlist checks do not fail on case-sensitive IDs. Landed from contributor PR #31201. Thanks @williamos-dev.
- Slack/Subagent completion delivery: stop forcing bound conversation IDs into `threadId` so Slack completion announces do not send invalid `thread_ts` for DMs/top-level channels. Landed from contributor PR #31105. Thanks @stakeswky.
- Signal/Loop protection: evaluate own-account detection before sync-message filtering (including UUID-only `accountUuid` configs) so `sentTranscript` sync events cannot bypass loop protection and self-reply loops. Landed from contributor PR #31093. Thanks @kevinWangSheng.
- Discord/DM command auth: unify DM allowlist + pairing-store authorization across message preflight and native command interactions so DM command gating is consistent for `open`/`pairing`/`allowlist` policies.
- Slack/download-file scoping: thread/channel-aware `download-file` actions now propagate optional scope context and reject downloads when Slack metadata definitively shows the file is outside the requested channel/thread, while preserving legacy behavior when share metadata is unavailable.
- Routing/Binding peer-kind parity: treat `peer.kind` `group` and `channel` as equivalent for binding scope matching (while keeping `direct` separate) so Slack/public channel bindings do not silently fall through. Landed from contributor PR #31135. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Discord/Reconnect integrity: release Discord message listener lane immediately while preserving serialized handler execution, add HELLO-stall resume-first recovery with bounded fresh-identify fallback after repeated stalls, and extend lifecycle/listener regression coverage for forced reconnect scenarios. Landed from contributor PR #29508. Thanks @cgdusek.
- Discord/Reconnect watchdog: add a shared armable transport stall-watchdog and wire Discord gateway lifecycle force-stop semantics for silent close/reconnect zombies, with gateway/lifecycle watchdog regression coverage and runtime status liveness updates. Follow-up to contributor PR #31025 by @theotarr and PR #30530 by @liuxiaopai-ai. Thanks @theotarr and @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Matrix/Conduit compatibility: avoid blocking startup on non-resolving Matrix sync start, preserve startup error propagation, prevent duplicate monitor listener registration, remove unreliable 2-member DM heuristics, accept `!room` IDs without alias resolution, and add matrix monitor/client regression coverage. Landed from contributor PR #31023. Thanks @efe-arv.
- Slack/HTTP mode startup: treat Slack HTTP accounts as configured when `botToken` + `signingSecret` are present (without requiring `appToken`) in channel config/runtime status so webhook mode is not silently skipped. (#30567) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Slack/Socket reconnect reliability: reconnect Socket Mode after disconnect/start failures using bounded exponential backoff with abort-aware waits, while preserving clean shutdown behavior and adding disconnect/error helper tests. (#27232) Thanks @pandego.
- Slack/Thread session isolation: route channel/group top-level messages into thread-scoped sessions (`:thread:<ts>`) and read inbound `previousTimestamp` from the resolved thread session key, preventing cross-thread context bleed and stale timestamp lookups. (#10686) Thanks @pablohrcarvalho.
- Slack/Transient request errors: classify Slack request-error messages like `Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established` as transient in unhandled-rejection fatal detection, preventing temporary network drops from crash-looping the gateway. (#23169) Thanks @graysurf.
- Slack/Disabled channel startup: skip Slack monitor socket startup entirely when `channels.slack.enabled=false` (including configs that still contain valid tokens), preventing disabled accounts from opening websocket connections. (#30586) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Telegram/Outbound API proxy env: keep the Node 22 `autoSelectFamily` global-dispatcher workaround while restoring env-proxy support by using `EnvHttpProxyAgent` so `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` continue to apply to outbound requests. (#26207) Thanks @qsysbio-cjw for reporting and @rylena and @vincentkoc for work.
- Telegram/Thread fallback safety: when Telegram returns `message thread not found`, retry without `message_thread_id` only for DM-thread sends (not forum topics), and suppress first-attempt danger logs when retry succeeds. Landed from contributor PR #30892. Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Slack/Inbound media auth + HTML guard: keep Slack auth headers on forwarded shared attachment image downloads, and reject login/error HTML payloads (while allowing expected `.html` uploads) when resolving Slack media so auth failures do not silently pass as files. (#18642) Thanks @tumf.
- Slack/Bot attachment-only messages: when `allowBots: true`, bot messages with empty `text` now include non-forwarded attachment `text`/`fallback` content so webhook alerts are not silently dropped. (#27616) Thanks @lailoo.
- Slack/Onboarding token help: update setup text to include the “From manifest” app-creation path and current install wording for obtaining the `xoxb-` bot token. (#30846) Thanks @yzhong52.
- Feishu/Docx editing tools: add `feishu_doc` positional insert, table row/column operations, table-cell merge, and color-text updates; switch markdown write/append/insert to Descendant API insertion with large-document batching; and harden image uploads for data URI/base64/local-path inputs with strict validation and routing-safe upload metadata. (#29411) Thanks @Elarwei001.
- Discord/Allowlist diagnostics: add debug logs for guild/channel allowlist drops so operators can quickly identify ignored inbound messages and required allowlist entries. Landed from contributor PR #30966. Thanks @haosenwang1018.
- Discord/Ack reactions: add Discord-account-level `ackReactionScope` override and support explicit `off`/`none` values in shared config schemas to disable ack reactions per account. Landed from contributor PR #30400. Thanks @BlueBirdBack.
- Discord/Forum thread tags: support `appliedTags` on Discord thread-create actions and map to `applied_tags` for forum/media starter posts, with targeted thread-creation regression coverage. Landed from contributor PR #30358. Thanks @pushkarsingh32.
- Discord/Application ID fallback: parse bot application IDs from token prefixes without numeric precision loss and use token fallback only on transport/timeout failures when probing `/oauth2/applications/@me`. Landed from contributor PR #29695. Thanks @dhananjai1729.
- Discord/EventQueue timeout config: expose per-account `channels.discord.accounts.<id>.eventQueue.listenerTimeout` (and related queue options) so long-running handlers can avoid Carbon listener timeout drops. Landed from contributor PR #24270. Thanks @pdd-cli.
- Slack/Usage footer formatting: wrap session keys in inline code in full response-usage footers so Slack does not parse colon-delimited session segments as emoji shortcodes. (#30258) Thanks @pushkarsingh32.
- Slack/Socket Mode slash startup: treat `app.options()` registration as best-effort and fall back to static arg menus when listener registration fails, preventing Slack monitor startup crash loops on receiver init edge cases. (#21715) Thanks @AIflow-Labs.
- Slack/Legacy streaming config: map boolean `channels.slack.streaming=false` to unified streaming mode `off` (with `nativeStreaming=false`) so legacy configs correctly disable draft preview/native streaming instead of defaulting to `partial`. (#25990) Thanks @chilu18.
- Cron/Failure delivery routing: add `failureAlert.mode` (`announce|webhook`) and `failureAlert.accountId` support, plus `cron.failureDestination` and per-job `delivery.failureDestination` routing with duplicate-target suppression, best-effort skip behavior, and global+job merge semantics. Landed from contributor PR #31059. Thanks @kesor.
- Cron/announce delivery: stop duplicate completion announces when cron early-return paths already handled delivery, and replace descendant followup polling with push-based waits so cron summaries arrive without the old busy-loop fallback. (#39089) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron/Failure alerts: add configurable repeated-failure alerting with per-job overrides and Web UI cron editor support (`inherit|disabled|custom` with threshold/cooldown/channel/target fields). (#24789) Thanks @0xbrak.
- Cron/Isolated model defaults: resolve isolated cron `subagents.model` (including object-form `primary`) through allowlist-aware model selection so isolated cron runs honor subagent model defaults unless explicitly overridden by job payload model. (#11474) Thanks @AnonO6.
- Cron/Announce delivery status: keep isolated cron runs in `ok` state when execution succeeds but announce delivery fails (for example transient `pairing required`), while preserving `delivered=false` and delivery error context for visibility. (#31082) Thanks @YuzuruS.
- Cron/One-shot reliability: retry transient one-shot failures with bounded backoff and configurable retry policy before disabling. (#24435) Thanks @hugenshen.
- Cron/Schedule errors: notify users when a job is auto-disabled after repeated schedule computation failures. (#29098) Thanks @ningding97.
- Cron/One-shot reschedule re-arm: allow completed `at` jobs to run again when rescheduled to a later time than `lastRunAtMs`, while keeping completed non-rescheduled one-shot jobs inactive. (#28915) Thanks @arosstale.
- Cron/Store EBUSY fallback: retry `rename` on `EBUSY` and use `copyFile` fallback on Windows when replacing cron store files so busy-file contention no longer causes false write failures. (#16932) Thanks @sudhanva-chakra.
- Cron/Isolated payload selection: ignore `isError` payloads when deriving summary/output/delivery payload fallbacks, while preserving error-only fallback behavior when no non-error payload exists. (#21454) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Cron/Isolated CLI timeout ratio: avoid reusing persisted CLI session IDs on fresh isolated cron runs so the fresh watchdog profile is used and jobs do not abort at roughly one-third of configured `timeoutSeconds`. (#30140) Thanks @ningding97.
- Cron/Session target guardrail: reject creating or patching `sessionTarget: "main"` cron jobs when `agentId` is not the default agent, preventing invalid cross-agent main-session bindings at write time. (#30217) Thanks @liaosvcaf.
- Cron/Reminder session routing: preserve `job.sessionKey` for `sessionTarget="main"` runs so queued reminders wake and deliver in the originating scoped session/channel instead of being forced to the agent main session.
- Cron/Timezone regression guard: add explicit schedule coverage for `0 8 * * *` with `Asia/Shanghai` to ensure `nextRunAtMs` never rolls back to a past year and always advances to the next valid occurrence. (#30351)
- Cron/Isolated sessions list: persist the intended pre-run model/provider on isolated cron session entries so `sessions_list` reflects payload/session model overrides even when runs fail before post-run telemetry persistence. (#21279) Thanks @altaywtf.
- Cron tool/update flat params: recover top-level update patch fields when models omit the `patch` wrapper, and allow flattened update keys through tool input schema validation so `cron.update` no longer fails with `patch required` for valid flat payloads. (#23221)
- Web UI/Cron jobs: add schedule-kind and last-run-status filters to the Jobs list, with reset control and client-side filtering over loaded results. (#9510) Thanks @guxu11.
- Web UI/Chat sessions: add a cron-session visibility toggle in the session selector, fix cron-key detection across `cron:*` and `agent:*:cron:*` formats, and localize the new control labels/tooltips. (#26976) Thanks @ianderrington.
- Cron/Timer hot-loop guard: enforce a minimum timer re-arm delay when stale past-due jobs would otherwise trigger repeated `setTimeout(0)` loops, preventing event-loop saturation and log-flood behavior. (#29853) Thanks @FlamesCN.
- Models/provider config precedence: prefer exact `models.providers.<name>` matches before normalized provider aliases in embedded model resolution, preventing alias/canonical key collisions from applying the wrong provider `api`, `baseUrl`, or headers. (#35934) thanks @RealKai42.
- Models/Custom provider keys: trim custom provider map keys during normalization so image-capable models remain discoverable when provider keys are configured with leading/trailing whitespace. Landed from contributor PR #31202. Thanks @stakeswky.
- Agents/Model fallback: classify additional network transport errors (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`) as failover-worthy so fallback chains advance when primary providers are unreachable. Landed from contributor PR #19077. Thanks @ayanesakura.
- Agents/Copilot token refresh: refresh GitHub Copilot runtime API tokens after auth-expiry failures and re-run with the renewed token so long-running embedded/subagent turns do not fail on mid-session 401 expiry. Landed from contributor PR #8805. Thanks @Arthur742Ramos.
- Agents/Subagents delivery params: reject unsupported `sessions_spawn` channel-delivery params (`target`, `channel`, `to`, `threadId`, `replyTo`, `transport`) with explicit input errors so delivery intent does not silently leak output to the parent conversation. (#31000)
- Agents/FS workspace default: honor documented host file-tool default `tools.fs.workspaceOnly=false` when unset so host `write`/`edit` calls are not incorrectly workspace-restricted unless explicitly enabled. Landed from contributor PR #31128. Thanks @SaucePackets.
- Sessions/Followup queue: always schedule followup drain even when unexpected runtime exceptions escape `runReplyAgent`, preventing silent stuck followup backlogs after failed turns. (#30627)
- Sessions/Compaction safety: add transcript-size forced pre-compaction memory flush (`agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.forceFlushTranscriptBytes`, default 2MB) so long sessions recover without manual transcript deletion when token snapshots are stale. (#30655)
- Sessions/Usage accounting: persist `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` from the latest call snapshot (`lastCallUsage`) instead of accumulated multi-call totals, preventing inflated token/cost reporting in long tool/compaction runs. (#31005)
- Sessions/DM scope migration: when `session.dmScope` is non-`main`, retire stale `agent:*:main` delivery routing metadata once the matching direct-chat peer session is active, preventing duplicate Telegram/DM announce deliveries from legacy main sessions after scope migration. (#31010)
- Agents/Session status: read thinking/verbose/reasoning levels from persisted session state in `session_status` output when resolved levels are not provided, so status reflects runtime toggles correctly. (#30129) Thanks @YuzuruS.
- Agents/Tool-name recovery chain: normalize streamed alias/case tool names against the allowed set, preserve whitespace-only streamed placeholders to avoid collapsing to empty names, and repair/guard persisted blank `toolResult.toolName` values from matching tool calls to reduce repeated `Tool not found` loops in long sessions. Landed from contributor PRs #30620 and #30735, plus #30881. Thanks @Sid-Qin and @liuxiaopai-ai.
- Agents/Sessions list transcript paths: resolve `sessions_list` `transcriptPath` via agent-aware session path options and ignore combined-store sentinel paths (`(multiple)`) so listed transcript paths always point to the state directory. (#28379) Thanks @fafuzuoluo.
- Agents/Ollama discovery: skip Ollama discovery when explicit models are configured. (#28827) Thanks @Kansodata and @vincentkoc.
- Onboarding/Custom providers: raise default custom-provider model context window to the runtime hard minimum (16k) and auto-heal existing custom model entries below that threshold during reconfiguration, preventing immediate `Model context window too small (4096 tokens)` failures. (#21653) Thanks @r4jiv007.
- Onboarding/Custom providers: use Azure OpenAI-specific verification auth/payload shape (`api-key`, deployment-path chat completions payload) when probing Azure endpoints so valid Azure custom-provider setup no longer fails preflight. (#29421) Thanks @kunalk16.
- Feishu/Onboarding SecretRef guards: avoid direct `.trim()` calls on object-form `appId`/`appSecret` in onboarding credential checks, keep status semantics strict when an account explicitly sets empty `appId` (no fallback to top-level `appId`), recognize env SecretRef `appId`/`appSecret` as configured so readiness is accurate, and preserve unresolved SecretRef errors in default account resolution for actionable diagnostics. (#30903) Thanks @LiaoyuanNing.
- Memory/Hybrid recall: when strict hybrid scoring yields no hits, preserve keyword-backed matches using a text-weight floor so freshly indexed lexical canaries no longer disappear behind `minScore` filtering. (#29112) Thanks @ceo-nada.
- Feishu/Startup probes: serialize multi-account bot-info probes during monitor startup so large Feishu account sets do not burst `/open-apis/bot/v3/info`, bound startup probe latency/abort handling to avoid head-of-line stalls, and avoid triggering rate limits. (#26685, #29941) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Android/Onboarding + voice reliability: request per-toggle onboarding permissions, update pairing guidance to `openclaw devices list/approve`, restore assistant speech playback in mic capture flow, cancel superseded in-flight speech (mute + per-reply token rotation), and keep `talk.config` loads retryable after transient failures. (#29796) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Notifications auth race: return `NOT_AUTHORIZED` when `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is revoked between authorization precheck and delivery, instead of returning success while dropping the notification. (#30726) Thanks @obviyus.
- Commands/Owner-only tools: treat identified direct-chat senders as owners when no owner allowlist is configured, while preserving internal `operator.admin` owner sessions. (#26331) thanks @widingmarcus-cyber
- ACP/Harness thread spawn routing: force ACP harness thread creation through `sessions_spawn` (`runtime: "acp"`, `thread: true`) and explicitly forbid `message action=thread-create` for ACP harness requests, avoiding misrouted `Unknown channel` errors. (#30957) Thanks @dutifulbob.
- Agents/Message tool scoping: include other configured channels in scoped `message` tool action enum + description so isolated/cron runs can discover and invoke cross-channel actions without schema validation failures. Landed from contributor PR #20840. Thanks @altaywtf.
- Plugins/Discovery precedence: load bundled plugins before auto-discovered global extensions so bundled channel plugins win duplicate-ID resolution by default (explicit `plugins.load.paths` overrides remain highest precedence), with loader regression coverage. Landed from contributor PR #29710. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- CLI/Startup (Raspberry Pi + small hosts): speed up startup by avoiding unnecessary plugin preload on fast routes, adding root `--version` fast-path bootstrap bypass, parallelizing status JSON/non-JSON scans where safe, and enabling Node compile cache at startup with env override compatibility (`NODE_COMPILE_CACHE`, `NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE`). (#5871) Thanks @BookCatKid and @vincentkoc for raising startup reports, and @lupuletic for related startup work in #27973.
- CLI/Startup follow-up: add root `--help` fast-path bootstrap bypass with strict root-only matching, lazily resolve CLI channel options only when commands need them, merge build-time startup metadata (`dist/cli-startup-metadata.json`) with runtime catalog discovery so dynamic catalogs are preserved, and add low-power Linux doctor hints for compile-cache placement and respawn tuning. (#30975) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Docker/Compose gateway targeting: run `openclaw-cli` in the `openclaw-gateway` service network namespace, require gateway startup ordering, pin Docker setup to `gateway.mode=local`, sync `gateway.bind` from `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND`, default optional `CLAUDE_*` compose vars to empty values to reduce automation warning noise, and harden `openclaw-cli` with `cap_drop` (`NET_RAW`, `NET_ADMIN`) + `no-new-privileges`. Docs now call out the shared trust boundary explicitly. (#12504) Thanks @bvanderdrift and @vincentkoc.
- Docker/Image base annotations: add OCI labels for base image plus source/documentation/license metadata, include revision/version/created labels in Docker release builds, and document annotation keys/release context in install docs. Fixes #27945. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Config/Legacy gateway bind aliases: normalize host-style `gateway.bind` values (`0.0.0.0`/`::`/`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`) to supported bind modes (`lan`/`loopback`) during legacy migration so older configs recover without manual edits. (#30080) Thanks @liuxiaopai-ai and @vincentkoc.
- Podman/Quadlet setup: fix `sed` escaping and UID mismatch in Podman Quadlet setup. (#26414) Thanks @KnHack and @vincentkoc.
- Doctor/macOS state-dir safety: warn when OpenClaw state resolves inside iCloud Drive (`~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/...`) or `~/Library/CloudStorage/...`, because sync-backed paths can cause slower I/O and lock/sync races. (#31004) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Doctor/Linux state-dir safety: warn when OpenClaw state resolves to an `mmcblk*` mount source (SD or eMMC), because random I/O can be slower and media wear can increase under session and credential writes. (#31033) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- CLI/Cron run exit code: return exit code `0` only when `cron run` reports `{ ok: true, ran: true }`, and `1` for non-run/error outcomes so scripting/debugging reflects actual execution status. Landed from contributor PR #31121. Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- CLI/JSON preflight output: keep `--json` command stdout machine-readable by suppressing doctor preflight note output while still running legacy migration/config doctor flow. (#24368) Thanks @altaywtf.
- Issues/triage labeling: consolidate bug intake to a single bug issue form with required bug-type classification (regression/crash/behavior), auto-apply matching subtype labels from issue form content, and retire the separate regression template to reduce misfiled issue types and improve queue filtering. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Logging/Subsystem console timestamps: route subsystem console timestamp rendering through `formatConsoleTimestamp(...)` so `pretty` and timestamp-prefix output use local timezone formatting consistently instead of inline UTC `toISOString()` paths. (#25970) Thanks @openperf.
- Auto-reply/Block reply timeout path: normalize `onBlockReply(...)` execution through `Promise.resolve(...)` before timeout wrapping so mixed sync/async callbacks keep deterministic timeout behavior across strict TypeScript build paths. (#19779) Thanks @dalefrieswthat and @vincentkoc.
- Nodes/Screen recording guardrails: cap `nodes` tool `screen_record` `durationMs` to 5 minutes at both schema-validation and runtime invocation layers to prevent long-running blocking captures from unbounded durations. Landed from contributor PR #31106. Thanks @BlueBirdBack.
- Gateway/CLI session recovery: handle expired CLI session IDs gracefully by clearing stale session state and retrying without crashing gateway runs. Landed from contributor PR #31090. Thanks @frankekn.
- Onboarding/Docker token parity: use `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` as the default gateway token in interactive and non-interactive onboarding when `--gateway-token` is not provided, so `docker-setup.sh` token env/config values stay aligned. (#22658) Fixes #22638. Thanks @Clawborn and @vincentkoc.
- Channels/Command parsing parity: align command-body parsing fields with channel command-gating text for Slack, Signal, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, and BlueBubbles to avoid mention-strip mismatches and inconsistent command detection.
- File tools/tilde paths: expand `~/...` against the user home directory before workspace-root checks in host file read/write/edit paths, while preserving root-boundary enforcement so outside-root targets remain blocked. (#29779) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Memory/QMD update+embed output cap: discard captured stdout for `qmd update` and `qmd embed` runs (while keeping stderr diagnostics) so large index progress output no longer fails sync with `produced too much output` during boot/refresh. (#28900; landed from contributor PR #23311 by @haitao-sjsu) Thanks @haitao-sjsu.
- Config/Doctor group allowlist diagnostics: align `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` warnings with per-channel runtime semantics by excluding Google Chat sender-list checks and by warning when no-fallback channels (for example iMessage) omit `groupAllowFrom`, with regression coverage. (#28477) Thanks @tonydehnke.
- TUI/Session model status: clear stale runtime model identity when model overrides change so `/model` updates are reflected immediately in `sessions.patch` responses and `sessions.list` status surfaces. (#28619) Thanks @lejean2000.
- TUI/SIGTERM shutdown: ignore `setRawMode EBADF` teardown errors during `SIGTERM` exit so long-running TUI sessions do not crash on terminal shutdown races, while still rethrowing unrelated stop errors. (#29430) Thanks @Cormazabal.
- Browser/Navigate: resolve the correct `targetId` in navigate responses after renderer swaps. (#25326) Thanks @stone-jin and @vincentkoc.
- FS/Sandbox workspace boundaries: add a dedicated `outside-workspace` safe-open error code for root-escape checks, and propagate specific outside-workspace messages across edit/browser/media consumers instead of generic not-found/invalid-path fallbacks. (#29715) Thanks @YuzuruS.
- Diagnostics/Stuck session signal: add configurable stuck-session warning threshold via `diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs` (default 120000ms) to reduce false-positive warnings on long multi-tool turns. (#31032)
- Agents/error classification: check billing errors before context overflow heuristics in the agent runner catch block so spend-limit and quota errors show the billing-specific message instead of being misclassified as "Context overflow: prompt too large". (#40409) Thanks @ademczuk.

## 2026.2.26

### Changes

- Highlight: External Secrets Management introduces a full `openclaw secrets` workflow (`audit`, `configure`, `apply`, `reload`) with runtime snapshot activation, strict `secrets apply` target-path validation, safer migration scrubbing, ref-only auth-profile support, and dedicated docs. (#26155) Thanks @joshavant.
- ACP/Thread-bound agents: make ACP agents first-class runtimes for thread sessions with `acp` spawn/send dispatch integration, acpx backend bridging, lifecycle controls, startup reconciliation, runtime cleanup, and coalesced thread replies. (#23580) thanks @osolmaz.
- Agents/Routing CLI: add `openclaw agents bindings`, `openclaw agents bind`, and `openclaw agents unbind` for account-scoped route management, including channel-only to account-scoped binding upgrades, role-aware binding identity handling, plugin-resolved binding account IDs, and optional account-binding prompts in `openclaw channels add`. (#27195) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Codex/WebSocket transport: make `openai-codex` WebSocket-first by default (`transport: "auto"` with SSE fallback), keep explicit per-model/runtime transport overrides, and add regression coverage + docs for transport selection.
- Onboarding/Plugins: let channel plugins own interactive onboarding flows with optional `configureInteractive` and `configureWhenConfigured` hooks while preserving the generic fallback path. (#27191) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Auth/Onboarding: add an explicit account-risk warning and confirmation gate before starting Gemini CLI OAuth, and document the caution in provider docs and the Gemini CLI auth plugin README. (#16683) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Android/Nodes: add Android `device` capability plus `device.status` and `device.info` node commands, including runtime handler wiring and protocol/registry coverage for device status/info payloads. (#27664) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Nodes: add `notifications.list` support on Android nodes and expose `nodes notifications_list` in agent tooling for listing active device notifications. (#27344) thanks @obviyus.

### Fixes

- FS tools/workspaceOnly: honor `tools.fs.workspaceOnly=false` for host write and edit operations so FS tools can access paths outside the workspace when sandbox is off. (#28822) thanks @lailoo. Fixes #28763. Thanks @cjscld for reporting.
- Telegram/DM allowlist runtime inheritance: enforce `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` `allowFrom` requirements using effective account-plus-parent config across account-capable channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, IRC, BlueBubbles, WhatsApp), and align `openclaw doctor` checks to the same inheritance logic so DM traffic is not silently dropped after upgrades. (#27936) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Delivery queue/recovery backoff: prevent retry starvation by persisting `lastAttemptAt` on failed sends and deferring recovery retries until each entry's `lastAttemptAt + backoff` window is eligible, while continuing to recover ready entries behind deferred ones. Landed from contributor PR #27710. Thanks @Jimmy-xuzimo.
- Gemini OAuth/Auth flow: align OAuth project discovery metadata and endpoint fallback handling for Gemini CLI auth, including fallback coverage for environment-provided project IDs. (#16684) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Google Chat/Lifecycle: keep Google Chat `startAccount` pending until abort in webhook mode so startup is no longer interpreted as immediate exit, preventing auto-restart loops and webhook-target churn. (#27384) thanks @junsuwhy.
- Temp dirs/Linux umask: force `0700` permissions after temp-dir creation and self-heal existing writable temp dirs before trust checks so `umask 0002` installs no longer crash-loop on startup. Landed from contributor PR #27860. (#27853) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Nextcloud Talk/Lifecycle: keep `startAccount` pending until abort and stop the webhook monitor on shutdown, preventing `EADDRINUSE` restart loops when the gateway manages account lifecycle. (#27897) Thanks @steipete.
- Microsoft Teams/File uploads: acknowledge `fileConsent/invoke` immediately (`invokeResponse` before upload + file card send) so Teams no longer shows false "Something went wrong" timeout banners while upload completion continues asynchronously; includes updated async regression coverage. Landed from contributor PR #27641 by @scz2011.
- Queue/Drain/Cron reliability: harden lane draining with guaranteed `draining` flag reset on synchronous pump failures, reject new queue enqueues during gateway restart drain windows (instead of silently killing accepted tasks), add `/stop` queued-backlog cutoff metadata with stale-message skipping (while avoiding cross-session native-stop cutoff bleed), and raise isolated cron `agentTurn` outer safety timeout to avoid false 10-minute timeout races against longer agent session timeouts. (#27407, #27332, #27427)
- Typing/Main reply pipeline: always mark dispatch idle in `agent-runner` finalization so typing cleanup runs even when dispatcher `onIdle` does not fire, preventing stuck typing indicators after run completion. (#27250) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Typing/TTL safety net: add max-duration guardrails to shared typing callbacks so stuck lifecycle edges auto-stop typing indicators even when explicit idle/cleanup signals are missed. (#27428) Thanks @Crpdim.
- Typing/Cross-channel leakage: unify run-scoped typing suppression for cross-channel/internal-webchat routes, preserve current inbound origin as embedded run message channel context, harden shared typing keepalive with consecutive-failure circuit breaker edge-case handling, and enforce dispatcher completion/idle waits in extension dispatcher callsites (Feishu, Matrix, Mattermost, MSTeams) so typing indicators always clean up on success/error paths. Related: #27647, #27493, #27598. Supersedes/replaces draft PRs: #27640, #27593, #27540.
- Telegram/sendChatAction 401 handling: add bounded exponential backoff + temporary local typing suppression after repeated unauthorized failures to stop unbounded `sendChatAction` retry loops that can trigger Telegram abuse enforcement and bot deletion. (#27415) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Telegram/Webhook startup: clarify webhook config guidance, allow `channels.telegram.webhookPort: 0` for ephemeral listener binding, and log both the local listener URL and Telegram-advertised webhook URL with the bound port. (#25732) thanks @huntharo.
- Config/Doctor allowlist safety: reject `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` configs with empty `allowFrom`, add Telegram account-level inheritance-aware validation, and teach `openclaw doctor --fix` to restore missing `allowFrom` entries from pairing-store files when present, preventing silent DM drops after upgrades. (#27936) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Browser/Chrome extension handshake: bind relay WS message handling before `onopen` and add non-blocking `connect.challenge` response handling for gateway-style handshake frames, avoiding stuck `…` badge states when challenge frames arrive immediately on connect. Landed from contributor PR #22571 by @pandego. (#22553)
- Browser/Extension relay init: dedupe concurrent same-port relay startup with shared in-flight initialization promises so callers await one startup lifecycle and receive consistent success/failure results. Landed from contributor PR #21277 by @HOYALIM. (Related #20688)
- Browser/Fill relay + CLI parity: accept `act.fill` fields without explicit `type` by defaulting missing/empty `type` to `text` in both browser relay route parsing and `openclaw browser fill` CLI field parsing, so relay calls no longer fail when the model omits field type metadata. Landed from contributor PR #27662. (#27296) Thanks @Uface11.
- Feishu/Permission error dispatch: merge sender-name permission notices into the main inbound dispatch so one user message produces one agent turn/reply (instead of a duplicate permission-notice turn), with regression coverage. (#27381) thanks @byungsker.
- Feishu/Merged forward parsing: expand inbound `merge_forward` messages by fetching and formatting API sub-messages in order, so merged forwards provide usable content context instead of only a placeholder line. (#28707) Thanks @tsu-builds.
- Agents/Canvas default node resolution: when multiple connected canvas-capable nodes exist and no single `mac-*` candidate is selected, default to the first connected candidate instead of failing with `node required` for implicit-node canvas tool calls. Landed from contributor PR #27444. Thanks @carbaj03.
- TUI/stream assembly: preserve streamed text across real tool-boundary drops without keeping stale streamed text when non-text blocks appear only in the final payload. Landed from contributor PR #27711 by @scz2011. (#27674)
- Hooks/Internal `message:sent`: forward `sessionKey` on outbound sends from agent delivery, cron isolated delivery, gateway receipt acks, heartbeat sends, session-maintenance warnings, and restart-sentinel recovery so internal `message:sent` hooks consistently dispatch with session context, including `openclaw agent --deliver` runs resumed via `--session-id` (without explicit `--session-key`). Landed from contributor PR #27584. Thanks @qualiobra.
- Pi image-token usage: stop re-injecting history image blocks each turn, process image references from the current prompt only, and prune already-answered user-image blocks in stored history to prevent runaway token growth. (#27602) Thanks @steipete.
- BlueBubbles/SSRF: auto-allowlist the configured `serverUrl` hostname for attachment fetches so localhost/private-IP BlueBubbles setups are no longer false-blocked by default SSRF checks. Landed from contributor PR #27648 by @lailoo. (#27599) Thanks @taylorhou for reporting.
- Agents/Compaction + onboarding safety: prevent destructive double-compaction by stripping stale assistant usage around compaction boundaries, skipping post-compaction custom metadata writes in the same attempt, and cancelling safeguard compaction when there are no real conversation messages to summarize; harden workspace/bootstrap detection for memory-backed workspaces; and change `openclaw onboard --reset` default scope to `config+creds+sessions` (workspace deletion now requires `--reset-scope full`). (#26458, #27314) Thanks @jaden-clovervnd, @Sid-Qin, and @widingmarcus-cyber for fix direction in #26502, #26529, and #27492.
- NO_REPLY suppression: suppress `NO_REPLY` before Slack API send and in sub-agent announce completion flow so sentinel text no longer leaks into user channels. Landed from contributor PRs #27529 (by @Sid-Qin) and #27535 (rewritten minimal landing by maintainers). (#27387, #27531)
- Matrix/Group sender identity: preserve sender labels in Matrix group inbound prompt text (`BodyForAgent`) for both channel and threaded messages, and align group envelopes with shared inbound sender-prefix formatting so first-person requests resolve against the current sender. (#27401) thanks @koushikxd.
- Auto-reply/Streaming: suppress only exact `NO_REPLY` final replies while still filtering streaming partial sentinel fragments (`NO_`, `NO_RE`, `HEARTBEAT_...`) so substantive replies ending with `NO_REPLY` are delivered and partial silent tokens do not leak during streaming. (#19576) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Auto-reply/Inbound metadata: add a readable `timestamp` field to conversation info and ignore invalid/out-of-range timestamp values so prompt assembly never crashes on malformed timestamp inputs. (#17017) thanks @liuy.
- Typing/Run completion race: prevent post-run keepalive ticks from re-triggering typing callbacks by guarding `triggerTyping()` with `runComplete`, with regression coverage for no-restart behavior during run-complete/dispatch-idle boundaries. (#27413) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Typing/Dispatch idle: force typing cleanup when `markDispatchIdle` never arrives after run completion, avoiding leaked typing keepalive loops in cron/announce edges. Landed from contributor PR #27541 by @Sid-Qin. (#27493)
- Telegram/Inline buttons: allow callback-query button handling in groups (including `/models` follow-up buttons) when group policy authorizes the sender, by removing the redundant callback allowlist gate that blocked open-policy groups. (#27343) Thanks @GodsBoy.
- Telegram/Streaming preview: when finalizing without an existing preview message, prime pending preview text with final answer before stop-flush so users do not briefly see stale 1-2 word fragments (for example `no` before `no problem`). (#27449) Thanks @emanuelst for the original fix direction in #19673.
- Browser/Extension relay CORS: handle `/json*` `OPTIONS` preflight before auth checks, allow Chrome extension origins, and return extension-origin CORS headers on relay HTTP responses so extension token validation no longer fails cross-origin. Landed from contributor PR #23962 by @miloudbelarebia. (#23842)
- Browser/Extension relay auth: allow `?token=` query-param auth on relay `/json*` endpoints (consistent with relay WebSocket auth) so curl/devtools-style `/json/version` and `/json/list` probes work without requiring custom headers. Landed from contributor PR #26015 by @Sid-Qin. (#25928)
- Browser/Extension relay shutdown: flush pending extension-request timers/rejections during relay `stop()` before socket/server teardown so in-flight extension waits do not survive shutdown windows. Landed from contributor PR #24142 by @kevinWangSheng.
- Browser/Extension relay reconnect resilience: keep CDP clients alive across brief MV3 extension disconnect windows, wait briefly for extension reconnect before failing in-flight CDP commands, and only tear down relay target/client state after reconnect grace expires. Landed from contributor PR #27617 by @davidemanuelDEV.
- Browser/Route decode hardening: guard malformed percent-encoding in relay target action routes and browser route-param decoding so crafted `%` paths return `400` instead of crashing/unhandled URI decode failures. Landed from contributor PR #11880 by @Yida-Dev.
- Browser/Writable output path hardening: reject existing hardlinked writable targets, and finalize browser download/trace outputs via sibling temp files plus atomic rename to block hardlink-alias overwrite paths under browser temp roots.
- Feishu/Inbound message metadata: include inbound `message_id` in `BodyForAgent` on a dedicated metadata line so agents can reliably correlate and act on media/message operations that require message IDs, with regression coverage. (#27253) thanks @xss925175263.
- Feishu/Doc tools: route `feishu_doc` and `feishu_app_scopes` through the active agent account context (with explicit `accountId` override support) so multi-account agents no longer default to the first configured app, with regression coverage for context routing and explicit override behavior. (#27338) thanks @AaronL725.
- LINE/Inline directives auth: gate directive parsing (`/model`, `/think`, `/verbose`, `/reasoning`, `/queue`) on resolved authorization (`command.isAuthorizedSender`) so `commands.allowFrom`-authorized LINE senders are not silently stripped when raw `CommandAuthorized` is unset. Landed from contributor PR #27248 by @kevinWangSheng. (#27240)
- Onboarding/Gateway: seed default Control UI `allowedOrigins` for non-loopback binds during onboarding (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1` plus custom bind host) so fresh non-loopback setups do not fail startup due to missing origin policy. (#26157) thanks @stakeswky.
- Docker/GCP onboarding: reduce first-build OOM risk by capping Node heap during `pnpm install`, reuse existing gateway token during `docker-setup.sh` reruns so `.env` stays aligned with config, auto-bootstrap Control UI allowed origins for non-loopback Docker binds, and add GCP docs guidance for tokenized dashboard links + pairing recovery commands. (#26253) Thanks @pandego.
- CLI/Gateway `--force` in non-root Docker: recover from `lsof` permission failures (`EACCES`/`EPERM`) by falling back to `fuser` kill + probe-based port checks, so `openclaw gateway --force` works for default container `node` user flows. (#27941) Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/Bind visibility: emit a startup warning when binding to non-loopback addresses so operators get explicit exposure guidance in runtime logs. (#25397) thanks @let5sne.
- Sessions cleanup/Doctor: add `openclaw sessions cleanup --fix-missing` to prune store entries whose transcript files are missing, including doctor guidance and CLI coverage. Landed from contributor PR #27508 by @Sid-Qin. (#27422)
- Doctor/State integrity: ignore metadata-only slash routing sessions when checking recent missing transcripts so `openclaw doctor` no longer reports false-positive transcript-missing warnings for `*:slash:*` keys. (#27375) thanks @gumadeiras.
- CLI/Gateway status: force local `gateway status` probe host to `127.0.0.1` for `bind=lan` so co-located probes do not trip non-loopback plaintext WebSocket checks. (#26997) thanks @chikko80.
- CLI/Gateway auth: align `gateway run --auth` parsing/help text with supported gateway auth modes by accepting `none` and `trusted-proxy` (in addition to `token`/`password`) for CLI overrides. (#27469) thanks @s1korrrr.
- CLI/Daemon status TLS probe: use `wss://` and forward local TLS certificate fingerprint for TLS-enabled gateway daemon probes so `openclaw daemon status` works with `gateway.bind=lan` + `gateway.tls.enabled=true`. (#24234) thanks @liuy.
- Podman/Default bind: change `run-openclaw-podman.sh` default gateway bind from `lan` to `loopback` and document explicit LAN opt-in with Control UI origin configuration. (#27491) thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Daemon/macOS launchd: forward proxy env vars into supervised service environments, keep LaunchAgent `KeepAlive=true` semantics, and harden restart sequencing to `print -> bootout -> wait old pid exit -> bootstrap -> kickstart`. (#27276) thanks @frankekn.
- Gateway/macOS restart-loop hardening: detect OpenClaw-managed supervisor markers during SIGUSR1 restart handoff, clean stale gateway PIDs before `/restart` launchctl/systemctl triggers, and set LaunchAgent `ThrottleInterval=60` to bound launchd retry storms during lock-release races. Landed from contributor PRs #27655 (@taw0002), #27448 (@Sid-Qin), and #27650 (@kevinWangSheng). (#27605, #27590, #26904, #26736)
- Models/MiniMax auth header defaults: set `authHeader: true` for both onboarding-generated MiniMax API providers and implicit built-in MiniMax (`minimax`, `minimax-portal`) provider templates so first requests no longer fail with MiniMax `401 authentication_error` due to missing `Authorization` header. Landed from contributor PRs #27622 by @riccoyuanft and #27631 by @kevinWangSheng. (#27600, #15303)
- Models/Google Antigravity IDs: normalize bare `gemini-3-pro`, `gemini-3.1-pro`, and `gemini-3-1-pro` model IDs to the default `-low` thinking tier so provider requests no longer fail with 404 when the tier suffix is omitted. (#24145) Thanks @byungsker.
- Auth/Auth profiles: normalize `auth-profiles.json` alias fields (`mode -> type`, `apiKey -> key`) before credential validation so entries copied from `openclaw.json` auth examples are no longer silently dropped. (#26950) thanks @byungsker.
- Models/Google Gemini: treat `google` (Gemini API key auth profile) as a reasoning-tag provider to prevent `<think>` leakage, and add forward-compat model fallback for `google-gemini-cli` `gemini-3.1-pro*` / `gemini-3.1-flash*` IDs to avoid false unknown-model errors. (#26551, #26524) Thanks @byungsker.
- Models/Profile suffix parsing: centralize trailing `@profile` parsing and only treat `@` as a profile separator when it appears after the final `/`, preserving model IDs like `openai/@cf/...` and `openrouter/@preset/...` across `/model` directive parsing and allowlist model resolution, with regression coverage.
- Models/OpenAI Codex config schema parity: accept `openai-codex-responses` in the config model API schema and TypeScript `ModelApi` union, with regression coverage for config validation. Landed from contributor PR #27501. Thanks @AytuncYildizli.
- Agents/Models config: preserve agent-level provider `apiKey` and `baseUrl` during merge-mode `models.json` updates when agent values are present. (#27293) thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Azure OpenAI Responses: force `store=true` for `azure-openai-responses` direct responses API calls to avoid multi-turn 400 failures. Landed from contributor PR #27499 by @polarbear-Yang. (#27497)
- Security/Node exec approvals: require structured `commandArgv` approvals for `host=node`, enforce `systemRunBinding` matching for argv/cwd/session/agent/env context with fail-closed behavior on missing/mismatched bindings, and add `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` to blocked host env keys. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Command authorization: enforce sender authorization for natural-language abort triggers (`stop`-like text) and `/models` listings, preventing unauthorized session aborts and model-auth metadata disclosure. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.27`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Plugin channel HTTP auth: normalize protected `/api/channels` path checks against canonicalized request paths (case + percent-decoding + slash normalization), resolve encoded dot-segment traversal variants, and fail closed on malformed `%`-encoded channel prefixes so alternate-path variants cannot bypass gateway auth. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Security/Gateway node pairing: pin paired-device `platform`/`deviceFamily` metadata across reconnects and bind those fields into device-auth signatures, so reconnect metadata spoofing cannot expand node command allowlists without explicit repair pairing. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @76embiid21 for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox path alias guard: reject broken symlink targets by resolving through existing ancestors and failing closed on out-of-root targets, preventing workspace-only `apply_patch` writes from escaping sandbox/workspace boundaries via dangling symlinks. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Workspace FS boundary aliases: harden canonical boundary resolution for non-existent-leaf symlink aliases while preserving valid in-root aliases, preventing first-write workspace escapes via out-of-root symlink targets. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Config includes: harden `$include` file loading with verified-open reads, reject hardlinked include aliases, and enforce include file-size guardrails so config include resolution remains bounded to trusted in-root files. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Security/Node exec approvals hardening: freeze immutable approval-time execution plans (`argv`/`cwd`/`agentId`/`sessionKey`) via `system.run.prepare`, enforce those canonical plan values during approval forwarding/execution, and reject mutable parent-symlink cwd paths during approval-plan building to prevent approval bypass via symlink rebind. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Microsoft Teams media fetch: route Graph message/hosted-content/attachment fetches and auth-scope fallback attachment downloads through shared SSRF-guarded fetch paths, and centralize hostname-suffix allowlist policy helpers in the plugin SDK to remove channel/plugin drift. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Voice Call (Twilio): bind webhook replay + manager dedupe identity to authenticated request material, remove unsigned `i-twilio-idempotency-token` trust from replay/dedupe keys, and thread verified request identity through provider parse flow to harden cross-provider event dedupe. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals forwarding: prefer turn-source channel/account/thread metadata when resolving approval delivery targets so stale session routes do not misroute approval prompts.
- Security/Pairing multi-account isolation: enforce account-scoped pairing allowlists and pending-request storage across core + extension message channels while preserving channel-scoped defaults for the default account. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting and @gumadeiras for implementation.
- Memory/SQLite: deduplicate concurrent memory-manager initialization and auto-reopen stale SQLite handles after atomic reindex swaps, preventing repeated `attempt to write a readonly database` sync failures until gateway restart.
- Config/Plugins entries: treat unknown `plugins.entries.*` ids as startup warnings (ignored stale keys) instead of hard validation failures that can crash-loop gateway boot. Landed from contributor PR #27506 by @Sid-Qin. (#27455)
- Telegram native commands: degrade command registration on `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` by retrying with fewer commands instead of crash-looping startup sync. Landed from contributor PR #27512 by @Sid-Qin. (#27456)
- Web tools/Proxy: route `web_search` provider HTTP calls (Brave, Perplexity, xAI, Gemini, Kimi), redirect resolution, and `web_fetch` through a shared proxy-aware SSRF guard path so gateway installs behind `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` no longer fail with transport `fetch failed` errors. (#27430) thanks @kevinWangSheng.
- Android/Node invoke: remove native gateway WebSocket `Origin` header to avoid false origin rejections, unify invoke command registry/policy/error parsing paths, and keep command availability checks centralized to reduce dispatcher/advertisement drift. (#27257) Thanks @obviyus.
- Gateway shared-auth scopes: preserve requested operator scopes for shared-token clients when device identity is unavailable, instead of clearing scopes during auth handling. Landed from contributor PR #27498 by @kevinWangSheng. (#27494)
- Cron/Hooks isolated routing: preserve canonical `agent:*` session keys in isolated runs so already-qualified keys are not double-prefixed (for example `agent:main:main` no longer becomes `agent:main:agent:main:main`). Landed from contributor PR #27333 by @MaheshBhushan. (#27289, #27282)
- Channels/Multi-account config: when adding a non-default channel account to a single-account top-level channel setup, move existing account-scoped top-level single-account values into `channels.<channel>.accounts.default` before writing the new account so the original account keeps working without duplicated account values at channel root; `openclaw doctor --fix` now repairs previously mixed channel account shapes the same way. (#27334) thanks @gumadeiras.
- iOS/Talk mode: stop injecting the voice directive hint into iOS Talk prompts and remove the Voice Directive Hint setting, reducing model bias toward tool-style TTS directives and keeping relay responses text-first by default. (#27543) thanks @ngutman.
- Mattermost/mention gating: honor `chatmode: "onmessage"` account override in inbound group/channel mention-gate resolution, while preserving explicit group `requireMention` config precedence and adding verbose drop diagnostics for skipped inbound posts. (#27160) thanks @turian.

## 2026.2.25

### Changes

- Android/Chat: improve streaming delivery handling and markdown rendering quality in the native Android chat UI, including better GitHub-flavored markdown behavior. (#26079) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Startup perf: defer foreground-service startup, move WebView debugging init out of critical startup, and add startup macrobenchmark + low-noise perf CLI scripts for deterministic cold-start tracking. (#26659) Thanks @obviyus.
- UI/Chat compose: add mobile stacked layout for compose action buttons on small screens to improve send/session controls usability. (#11167) Thanks @junyiz.
- Heartbeat/Config: replace heartbeat DM toggle with `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy` (`allow` | `block`; also supported per-agent via `agents.list[].heartbeat.directPolicy`) for clearer delivery semantics.
- Onboarding/Security: clarify onboarding security notices that OpenClaw is personal-by-default (single trusted operator boundary) and shared/multi-user setups require explicit lock-down/hardening.
- Branding/Docs + Apple surfaces: replace remaining `bot.molt` launchd label, bundle-id, logging subsystem, and command examples with `ai.openclaw` across docs, iOS app surfaces, helper scripts, and CLI test fixtures.
- Agents/Config: remind agents to call `config.schema` before config edits or config-field questions to avoid guessing. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Dependencies: update workspace dependency pins and lockfile (Bedrock SDK `3.998.0`, `@mariozechner/pi-*` `0.55.1`, TypeScript native preview `7.0.0-dev.20260225.1`) while keeping `@buape/carbon` pinned.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Heartbeat direct/DM delivery default is now `allow` again. To keep DM-blocked behavior from `2026.2.24`, set `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy: "block"` (or per-agent override).

### Fixes

- Slack/Identity: thread agent outbound identity (`chat:write.customize` overrides) through the channel reply delivery path so per-agent username, icon URL, and icon emoji are applied to all Slack replies including media messages. (#27134) Thanks @hou-rong.
- Slack/Threading: resolve `replyToMode` per incoming message using chat-type-aware account config (`replyToModeByChatType` and legacy `dm.replyToMode`) so DM/channel reply threading honors overrides instead of always using monitor startup defaults. (#24717) Thanks @dbachelder.
- Slack/Threading: track bot participation in message threads (per account/channel/thread) so follow-up messages in those threads can be handled without requiring repeated @mentions, while preserving mention-gating behavior for unrelated threads. (#29165) Thanks @luijoc.
- Slack/Threading: stop forcing tool-call reply mode to `all` based on `ThreadLabel` alone; now force thread reply mode only when an explicit thread target exists (`MessageThreadId`/`ReplyToId`), so DM `replyToModeByChatType.direct` overrides are honored outside real thread replies. (#26251) Thanks @dbachelder.
- Slack/Threading: when `replyToMode="all"` auto-threads top-level Slack DMs, seed the thread session key from the message `ts` so the initial message and later replies share the same isolated `:thread:` session instead of falling back to base DM context. (#26849) Thanks @calder-sandy.
- Agents/Subagents delivery: refactor subagent completion announce dispatch into an explicit queue/direct/fallback state machine, recover outbound channel-plugin resolution in cold/stale plugin-registry states across announce/message/gateway send paths, finalize cleanup bookkeeping when announce flow rejects, and treat Telegram sends without `message_id` as delivery failures (instead of false-success `"unknown"` IDs). (#26867, #25961, #26803, #25069, #26741) Thanks @SmithLabsLLC and @docaohieu2808.
- Telegram/Webhook: pre-initialize webhook bots, switch webhook processing to callback-mode JSON handling, and preserve full near-limit payload reads under delayed handlers to prevent webhook request hangs and dropped updates. (#26156) Thanks @steipete.
- Slack/Session threads: prevent oversized parent-session inheritance from silently bricking new thread sessions, surface embedded context-overflow empty-result failures to users, and add configurable `session.parentForkMaxTokens` (default `100000`, `0` disables). (#26912) Thanks @markshields-tl.
- Cron/Message multi-account routing: honor explicit `delivery.accountId` for isolated cron delivery resolution, and when `message.send` omits `accountId`, fall back to the sending agent's bound channel account instead of defaulting to the global account. (#27015, #26975) Thanks @lbo728 and @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Message media roots: thread `agentId` through gateway `send` RPC and prefer explicit `agentId` over session/default resolution so non-default agent workspace media sends no longer fail with `LocalMediaAccessError`; added regression coverage for agent precedence and blank-agent fallback. (#23249) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Followups/Routing: when explicit origin routing fails, allow same-channel fallback dispatch (while still blocking cross-channel fallback) so followup replies do not get dropped on transient origin-adapter failures. (#26109) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Cron/Announce duplicate guard: track attempted announce/direct delivery separately from confirmed `delivered`, and suppress fallback main-session cron summaries when delivery was already attempted to avoid duplicate end-user sends in uncertain-ack paths. (#27018) Thanks @steipete.
- LINE/Lifecycle: keep LINE `startAccount` pending until abort so webhook startup is no longer misread as immediate channel exit, preventing restart-loop storms on LINE provider boot. (#26528) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Discord/Gateway: capture and drain startup-time gateway `error` events before lifecycle listeners attach so early `Fatal Gateway error: 4014` closes surface as actionable intent guidance instead of uncaught gateway crashes. (#23832) Thanks @theotarr.
- Discord/Inbound text: preserve embed `title` + `description` fallback text in message and forwarded snapshot parsing so embed titles are not silently dropped from agent input. (#26946) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Slack/Inbound media fallback: deliver file-only messages even when Slack media downloads fail by adding a filename placeholder fallback, capping fallback names to the shared media-file limit, and normalizing empty filenames to `file` so attachment-only messages are not silently dropped. (#25181) Thanks @justinhuangcode.
- Telegram/Preview cleanup: keep finalized text previews when a later assistant message is media-only (for example mixed text plus voice turns) by skipping finalized preview archival at assistant-message boundaries, preventing cleanup from deleting already-visible final text messages. (#27042) Thanks @steipete.
- Telegram/Markdown spoilers: keep valid `||spoiler||` pairs while leaving unmatched trailing `||` delimiters as literal text, avoiding false all-or-nothing spoiler suppression. (#26105) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Slack/Allowlist channels: match channel IDs case-insensitively during channel allowlist resolution so lowercase config keys (for example `c0abc12345`) correctly match Slack runtime IDs (`C0ABC12345`) under `groupPolicy: "allowlist"`, preventing silent channel-event drops. (#26878) Thanks @lbo728.
- Discord/Typing indicator: prevent stuck typing indicators by sealing channel typing keepalive callbacks after idle/cleanup and ensuring Discord dispatch always marks typing idle even if preview-stream cleanup fails. (#26295) Thanks @ngutman.
- Channels/Typing indicator: guard typing keepalive start callbacks after idle/cleanup close so post-close ticks cannot re-trigger stale typing indicators. (#26325) Thanks @win4r.
- Followups/Typing indicator: ensure followup turns mark dispatch idle on every exit path (including `NO_REPLY`, empty payloads, and agent errors) so typing keepalive cleanup always runs and channel typing indicators do not get stuck after queued/silent followups. (#26881) Thanks @codexGW.
- Voice-call/TTS tools: hide the `tts` tool when the message provider is `voice`, preventing voice-call runs from selecting self-playback TTS and falling into silent no-output loops. (#27025) Thanks @steipete.
- Agents/Tools: normalize non-standard plugin tool results that omit `content` so embedded runs no longer crash with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` after tool completion (including `tesseramemo_query`). (#27007) Thanks @steipete.
- Agents/Tool-call dispatch: trim whitespace-padded tool names in both transcript repair and live streamed embedded-runner responses so exact-match tool lookup no longer fails with `Tool ... not found` for model outputs like `" read "`. (#27094) Thanks @openperf and @Sid-Qin.
- Cron/Model overrides: when isolated `payload.model` is no longer allowlisted, fall back to default model selection instead of failing the job, while still returning explicit errors for invalid model strings. (#26717) Thanks @Youyou972.
- Agents/Model fallback: keep explicit text + image fallback chains reachable even when `agents.defaults.models` allowlists are present, prefer explicit run `agentId` over session-key parsing for followup fallback override resolution (with session-key fallback), treat agent-level fallback overrides as configured in embedded runner preflight, and classify `model_cooldown` / `cooling down` errors as `rate_limit` so failover continues. (#11972, #24137, #17231)
- Agents/Model fallback: keep same-provider fallback chains active when session model differs from configured primary, infer cooldown reason from provider profile state (instead of `disabledReason` only), keep no-profile fallback providers eligible (env/models.json paths), and only relax same-provider cooldown fallback attempts for `rate_limit`. (#23816) thanks @ramezgaberiel.
- Agents/Model fallback: continue fallback traversal on unrecognized errors when candidates remain, while still throwing the original unknown error on the last candidate. (#26106) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Models/Auth probes: map permanent auth failover reasons (`auth_permanent`, for example revoked keys) into probe auth status instead of `unknown`, so `openclaw models status --probe` reports actionable auth failures. (#25754) thanks @rrenamed.
- Hooks/Inbound metadata: include `guildId` and `channelName` in `message_received` metadata for both plugin and internal hook paths. (#26115) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Discord/Component auth: evaluate guild component interactions with command-gating authorizers so unauthorized users no longer get `CommandAuthorized: true` on modal/button events. (#26119) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Gateway auth: require pairing for operator device-identity sessions authenticated with shared token auth so unpaired devices cannot self-assign operator scopes. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway WebSocket auth: enforce origin checks for direct browser WebSocket clients beyond Control UI/Webchat, apply password-auth failure throttling to browser-origin loopback attempts (including localhost), and block silent auto-pairing for non-Control-UI browser clients to prevent cross-origin brute-force and session takeover chains. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @luz-oasis for reporting.
- Security/Gateway trusted proxy: require `operator` role for the Control UI trusted-proxy pairing bypass so unpaired `node` sessions can no longer connect via `client.id=control-ui` and invoke node event methods. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/macOS beta onboarding: remove Anthropic OAuth sign-in and the legacy `oauth.json` onboarding path that exposed the PKCE verifier via OAuth `state`; this impacted the macOS beta onboarding path only. Anthropic subscription auth is now setup-token-only and will ship in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @zdi-disclosures for reporting.
- Security/Microsoft Teams file consent: bind `fileConsent/invoke` upload acceptance/decline to the originating conversation before consuming pending uploads, preventing cross-conversation pending-file upload or cancellation via leaked `uploadId` values; includes regression coverage for match/mismatch invoke handling. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: harden `agents.files` path handling to block out-of-workspace symlink targets for `agents.files.get`/`agents.files.set`, keep in-workspace symlink targets supported, and add gateway regression coverage for both blocked escapes and allowed in-workspace symlinks. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Workspace FS: reject hardlinked workspace file aliases in `tools.fs.workspaceOnly` and `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` boundary checks (including sandbox mount-root guards) to prevent out-of-workspace read/write via in-workspace hardlink paths. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser temp paths: harden trace/download output-path handling against symlink-root and symlink-parent escapes with realpath-based write-path checks plus secure fallback tmp-dir validation that fails closed on unsafe fallback links. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser uploads: revalidate upload paths at use-time in Playwright file-chooser and direct-input flows so missing/rebound paths are rejected before `setFiles`, with regression coverage for strict missing-path handling.
- Security/Exec approvals: bind `system.run` approval matching to exact argv identity and preserve argv whitespace in rendered command text, preventing trailing-space executable path swaps from reusing a mismatched approval. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: harden approval-bound `system.run` execution on node hosts by rejecting symlink `cwd` paths and canonicalizing path-like executable argv before spawn, blocking mutable-cwd symlink retarget chains between approval and execution. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Signal: enforce DM/group authorization before reaction-only notification enqueue so unauthorized senders can no longer inject Signal reaction system events under `dmPolicy`/`groupPolicy`; reaction notifications now require channel access checks first. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Discord reactions: enforce DM policy/allowlist authorization before reaction-event system enqueue in direct messages; Discord reaction handling now also honors DM/group-DM enablement and guild `groupPolicy` channel gating to keep reaction ingress aligned with normal message preflight. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Slack reactions + pins: gate `reaction_*` and `pin_*` system-event enqueue through shared sender authorization so DM `dmPolicy`/`allowFrom` and channel `users` allowlists are enforced consistently for non-message ingress, with regression coverage for denied/allowed sender paths. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Slack member + message subtype events: gate `member_*` plus `message_changed`/`message_deleted`/`thread_broadcast` system-event enqueue through shared sender authorization so DM `dmPolicy`/`allowFrom` and channel `users` allowlists are enforced consistently for non-message ingress; message subtype system events now fail closed when sender identity is missing, with regression coverage. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Telegram reactions: enforce `dmPolicy`/`allowFrom` and group allowlist authorization on `message_reaction` events before enqueueing reaction system events, preventing unauthorized reaction-triggered input in DMs and groups; ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Telegram group allowlist: fail closed for group sender authorization by removing DM pairing-store fallback from group allowlist evaluation; group sender access now requires explicit `groupAllowFrom` or per-group/per-topic `allowFrom`. (#25988) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/DM-group allowlist boundaries: keep DM pairing-store approvals DM-only by removing pairing-store inheritance from group sender authorization in LINE and Mattermost message preflight, and by centralizing shared DM/group allowlist composition so group checks never include pairing-store entries. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Slack interactions: enforce channel/DM authorization and modal actor binding (`private_metadata.userId`) before enqueueing `block_action`/`view_submission`/`view_closed` system events, with regression coverage for unauthorized senders and missing/mismatched actor metadata. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: drop replayed signed webhook events with persistent per-account replay dedupe across restarts, and reject unexpected webhook backend origins when account base URL is configured. Thanks @aristorechina for reporting.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: reject unsigned webhook traffic before full body reads, reducing unauthenticated request-body exposure, with auth-order regression coverage. (#26118) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: stop treating DM pairing-store entries as group allowlist senders, so group authorization remains bounded to configured group allowlists. (#26116) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/LINE: cap unsigned webhook body reads before auth/signature handling to bound unauthenticated body processing. (#26095) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/IRC: keep pairing-store approvals DM-only and out of IRC group allowlist authorization, with policy regression tests for allowlist resolution. (#26112) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Microsoft Teams: isolate group allowlist and command authorization from DM pairing-store entries to prevent cross-context authorization bleed. (#26111) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/SSRF guard: classify IPv6 multicast literals (`ff00::/8`) as blocked/private-internal targets in shared SSRF IP checks, preventing multicast literals from bypassing URL-host preflight and DNS answer validation. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.26`). Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Tests/Low-memory stability: disable Vitest `vmForks` by default on low-memory local hosts (`<64 GiB`), keep low-profile extension lane parallelism at 4 workers, and align cron isolated-agent tests with `setSessionRuntimeModel` usage to avoid deterministic suite failures. (#26324) Thanks @ngutman.
- Feishu/WebSocket proxy: pass a proxy agent to Feishu WS clients from standard proxy environment variables and include plugin-local runtime dependency wiring so websocket mode works in proxy-constrained installs. (#26397) Thanks @colin719.

## 2026.2.24

### Changes

- Auto-reply/Abort shortcuts: expand standalone stop phrases (`stop openclaw`, `stop action`, `stop run`, `stop agent`, `please stop`, and related variants), accept trailing punctuation (for example `STOP OPENCLAW!!!`), add multilingual stop keywords (including ES/FR/ZH/HI/AR/JP/DE/PT/RU forms), and treat exact `do not do that` as a stop trigger while preserving strict standalone matching. (#25103) Thanks @steipete and @vincentkoc.
- Android/App UX: ship a native four-step onboarding flow, move post-onboarding into a five-tab shell (Connect, Chat, Voice, Screen, Settings), add a full Connect setup/manual mode screen, and refresh Android chat/settings surfaces for the new navigation model.
- Talk/Gateway config: add provider-agnostic Talk configuration with legacy compatibility, and expose gateway Talk ElevenLabs config metadata for setup/status surfaces.
- Security/Audit: add `security.trust_model.multi_user_heuristic` to flag likely shared-user ingress and clarify the personal-assistant trust model, with hardening guidance for intentional multi-user setups (`sandbox.mode="all"`, workspace-scoped FS, reduced tool surface, no personal/private identities on shared runtimes).
- Dependencies: refresh key runtime and tooling packages across the workspace (Bedrock SDK, pi runtime stack, OpenAI, Google auth, and oxlint/oxfmt), while intentionally keeping `@buape/carbon` pinned.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Heartbeat delivery now blocks direct/DM targets when destination parsing identifies a direct chat (for example `user:<id>`, Telegram user chat IDs, or WhatsApp direct numbers/JIDs). Heartbeat runs still execute, but direct-message delivery is skipped and only non-DM destinations (for example channel/group targets) can receive outbound heartbeat messages.
- **BREAKING:** Security/Sandbox: block Docker `network: "container:<id>"` namespace-join mode by default for sandbox and sandbox-browser containers. To keep that behavior intentionally, set `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.dangerouslyAllowContainerNamespaceJoin: true` (break-glass). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.

### Fixes

- Routing/Session isolation: harden followup routing so explicit cross-channel origin replies never fall back to the active dispatcher on route failure, preserve queued overflow summary routing metadata (`channel`/`to`/`thread`) across followup drain, and prefer originating channel context over internal provider tags for embedded followup runs. This prevents webchat/control-ui context from hijacking Discord-targeted replies in shared sessions. (#25864) Thanks @Gamedesigner.
- Security/Routing: fail closed for shared-session cross-channel replies by binding outbound target resolution to the current turn’s source channel metadata (instead of stale session route fallbacks), and wire those turn-source fields through gateway + command delivery planners with regression coverage. (#24571) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Heartbeat routing: prevent heartbeat leakage/spam into Discord and other direct-message destinations by blocking direct-chat heartbeat delivery targets and keeping blocked-delivery cron/exec prompts internal-only. (#25871) Thanks @steipete.
- Heartbeat defaults/prompts: switch the implicit heartbeat delivery target from `last` to `none` (opt-in for external delivery), and use internal-only cron/exec heartbeat prompt wording when delivery is disabled so background checks do not nudge user-facing relay behavior. (#25871, #24638, #25851)
- Auto-reply/Heartbeat queueing: drop heartbeat runs when a session already has an active run instead of enqueueing a stale followup, preventing duplicate heartbeat response branches after queue drain. (#25610, #25606) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Cron/Heartbeat delivery: stop inheriting cached session `lastThreadId` for heartbeat-mode target resolution unless a thread/topic is explicitly requested, so announce-mode cron and heartbeat deliveries stay on top-level destinations instead of leaking into active conversation threads. (#25730) Thanks @markshields-tl.
- Messaging tool dedupe: treat originating channel metadata as authoritative for same-target `message.send` suppression in proactive runs (heartbeat/cron/exec-event), including synthetic-provider contexts, so `delivery-mirror` transcript entries no longer cause duplicate Telegram sends. (#25835) Thanks @jadeathena84-arch.
- Channels/Typing keepalive: refresh channel typing callbacks on a keepalive interval during long replies and clear keepalive timers on idle/cleanup across core + extension dispatcher callsites so typing indicators do not expire mid-inference. (#25886, #25882) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Agents/Model fallback: when a run is currently on a configured fallback model, keep traversing the configured fallback chain instead of collapsing straight to primary-only, preventing dead-end failures when primary stays in cooldown. (#25922, #25912) Thanks @Taskle.
- Gateway/Models: honor explicit `agents.defaults.models` allowlist refs even when bundled model catalog data is stale, synthesize missing allowlist entries in `models.list`, and allow `sessions.patch`/`/model` selection for those refs without false `model not allowed` errors. (#20291) Thanks @kensipe, @nikolasdehor, and @vincentkoc.
- Control UI/Agents: inherit `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` in the Overview fallback input when no per-agent model entry exists, while preserving explicit per-agent fallback overrides (including empty lists). (#25729, #25710) Thanks @Suko.
- Automation/Subagent/Cron reliability: honor `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` in `sessions_spawn` completion/direct announce flows (no user-visible token leaks), add transient direct-announce retries for channel unavailability (for example WhatsApp listener reconnect windows), and include `cron` in the `coding` tool profile so `/tools/invoke` can execute cron actions when explicitly allowed by gateway policy. (#25800, #25656, #25842, #25813, #25822, #25821) Thanks @astra-fer, @aaajiao, @dwight11232-coder, @kevinWangSheng, @widingmarcus-cyber, and @stakeswky.
- Discord/Voice reliability: restore runtime DAVE dependency (`@snazzah/davey`), add configurable DAVE join options (`channels.discord.voice.daveEncryption` and `channels.discord.voice.decryptionFailureTolerance`), clean up voice listeners/session teardown, guard against stale connection events, and trigger controlled rejoin recovery after repeated decrypt failures to improve inbound STT stability under DAVE receive errors. (#25861, #25372, #24883, #24825, #23890, #23105, #22961, #23421, #23278, #23032)
- Discord/Block streaming: restore block-streamed reply delivery by suppressing only reasoning payloads (instead of all `block` payloads), fixing missing Discord replies in `channels.discord.streaming=block` mode. (#25839, #25836, #25792) Thanks @pewallin.
- Discord/Proxy + reactions + model picker: thread channel proxy fetch into inbound media/sticker downloads, use proxy-aware gateway metadata fetch for WSL/corporate proxy setups, wire `messages.statusReactions.{emojis,timing}` into Discord reaction lifecycle control, and compact model-picker `custom_id` keys to stay under Discord's 100-char limit while keeping backward-compatible parsing. (#25232, #25507, #25564, #25695) Thanks @openperf, @chilu18, @Yipsh, @lbo728, and @s1korrrr.
- WhatsApp/Web reconnect: treat close status `440` as non-retryable (including string-form status values), stop reconnect loops immediately, and emit operator guidance to relink after resolving session conflicts. (#25858) Thanks @markmusson.
- WhatsApp/Reasoning safety: suppress outbound payloads marked as reasoning and hard-drop text payloads that begin with `Reasoning:` before WhatsApp delivery, preventing hidden thinking blocks from leaking to end users through final-message paths. (#25804, #25214, #24328)
- Matrix/Read receipts: send read receipts as soon as Matrix messages arrive (before handler pipeline work), so clients no longer show long-lived unread/sent states while replies are processing. (#25841, #25840) Thanks @joshjhall.
- Telegram/Replies: when markdown formatting renders to empty HTML (for example syntax-only chunks in threaded replies), retry delivery with plain text, and fail loud when both formatted and plain payloads are empty to avoid false delivered states. (#25096, #25091) Thanks @ArsalanShakil.
- Telegram/Media fetch: prioritize IPv4 before IPv6 in SSRF pinned DNS address ordering so media downloads still work on hosts with broken IPv6 routing. (#24295, #23975) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Outbound API: replace Node 22's global undici dispatcher when applying Telegram `autoSelectFamily` decisions so outbound `fetch` calls inherit IPv4 fallback instead of staying pinned to stale dispatcher settings. (#25682, #25676) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Onboarding/Telegram: keep core-channel onboarding available when plugin registry population is missing by falling back to built-in adapters and continuing wizard setup with actionable recovery guidance. (#25803) Thanks @Suko.
- Android/Gateway auth: preserve Android gateway auth state across onboarding, use the native client id for operator sessions, retry with shared-token fallback after device-token auth failures, and avoid clearing tokens on transient connect errors.
- Slack/DM routing: treat `D*` channel IDs as direct messages even when Slack sends an incorrect `channel_type`, preventing DM traffic from being misclassified as channel/group chats. (#25479) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Zalo/Group policy: enforce sender authorization for group messages with `groupPolicy` + `groupAllowFrom` (fallback to `allowFrom`), default runtime group behavior to fail-closed allowlist, and block unauthorized non-command group messages before dispatch. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- macOS/Voice input: guard all audio-input startup paths against missing default microphones (Voice Wake, Talk Mode, Push-to-Talk, mic-level monitor, tester) to avoid launch/runtime crashes on mic-less Macs and fail gracefully until input becomes available. (#25817) Thanks @sfo2001.
- macOS/IME input: when marked text is active, treat Return as IME candidate confirmation first in both the voice overlay composer and shared chat composer to prevent accidental sends while composing CJK text. (#25178) Thanks @bottotl.
- macOS/Voice wake routing: default forwarded voice-wake transcripts to the `webchat` channel (instead of ambiguous `last` routing) so local voice prompts stay pinned to the control chat surface unless explicitly overridden. (#25440) Thanks @chilu18.
- macOS/Gateway launch: prefer an available `openclaw` binary before pnpm/node runtime fallback when resolving local gateway commands, so local startup no longer fails on hosts with broken runtime discovery. (#25512) Thanks @chilu18.
- macOS/Menu bar: stop reusing the injector delegate for the "Usage cost (30 days)" submenu to prevent recursive submenu injection loops when opening cost history. (#25341) Thanks @yingchunbai.
- macOS/WebChat panel: fix rounded-corner clipping by using panel-specific visual-effect blending and matching corner masking on both effect and hosting layers. (#22458) Thanks @apethree and @agisilaos.
- Windows/Exec shell selection: prefer PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) discovery (Program Files, ProgramW6432, PATH) before falling back to Windows PowerShell 5.1, fixing `&&` command chaining failures on Windows hosts with PS7 installed. (#25684, #25638) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Windows/Media safety checks: align async local-file identity validation with sync-safe-open behavior by treating win32 `dev=0` stats as unknown-device fallbacks (while keeping strict dev checks when both sides are non-zero), fixing false `Local media path is not safe to read` drops for local attachments/TTS/images. (#25708, #21989, #25699, #25878) Thanks @kevinWangSheng.
- iMessage/Reasoning safety: harden iMessage echo suppression with outbound `messageId` matching (plus scoped text fallback), and enforce reasoning-payload suppression on routed outbound delivery paths to prevent hidden thinking text from being sent as user-visible channel messages. (#25897, #1649, #25757) Thanks @rmarr and @Iranb.
- Providers/OpenRouter/Auth profiles: bypass auth-profile cooldown/disable windows for OpenRouter, so provider failures no longer put OpenRouter profiles into local cooldown and stale legacy cooldown markers are ignored in fallback and status selection paths. (#25892) Thanks @alexanderatallah for raising this and @vincentkoc for the fix.
- Providers/Google reasoning: sanitize invalid negative `thinkingBudget` payloads for Gemini 3.1 requests by dropping `-1` budgets and mapping configured reasoning effort to `thinkingLevel`, preventing malformed reasoning payloads on `google-generative-ai`. (#25900) Thanks @steipete.
- Providers/SiliconFlow: normalize `thinking="off"` to `thinking: null` for `Pro/*` model payloads to avoid provider-side 400 loops and misleading compaction retries. (#25435) Thanks @Zjianru.
- Models/Bedrock auth: normalize additional Bedrock provider aliases (`bedrock`, `aws-bedrock`, `aws_bedrock`, `amazon bedrock`) to canonical `amazon-bedrock`, ensuring auth-mode resolution consistently selects AWS SDK fallback. (#25756) Thanks @fwhite13.
- Models/Providers: preserve explicit user `reasoning` overrides when merging provider model config with built-in catalog metadata, so `reasoning: false` is no longer overwritten by catalog defaults. (#25314) Thanks @lbo728.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy authenticated Control UI websocket sessions to skip device pairing when device identity is absent, preventing false `pairing required` failures behind trusted reverse proxies. (#25428) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- CLI/Memory search: accept `--query <text>` for `openclaw memory search` (while keeping positional query support), and emit a clear error when neither form is provided. (#25904, #25857) Thanks @niceysam and @stakeswky.
- CLI/Doctor: correct stale recovery hints to use valid commands (`openclaw gateway status --deep` and `openclaw configure --section model`). (#24485) Thanks @chilu18.
- Doctor/Sandbox: when sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, surface a clear actionable warning (including failure impact and remediation) instead of a mild “skip checks” note. (#25438) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Doctor/Plugins: auto-enable now resolves third-party channel plugins by manifest plugin id (not channel id), preventing invalid `plugins.entries.<channelId>` writes when ids differ. (#25275) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Config/Plugins: treat stale removed `google-antigravity-auth` plugin references as compatibility warnings (not hard validation errors) across `plugins.entries`, `plugins.allow`, `plugins.deny`, and `plugins.slots.memory`, so startup no longer fails after antigravity removal. (#25538, #25862) Thanks @chilu18.
- Config/Meta: accept numeric `meta.lastTouchedAt` timestamps and coerce them to ISO strings, preserving compatibility with agent edits that write `Date.now()` values. (#25491) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Usage accounting: parse Moonshot/Kimi `cached_tokens` fields (including `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) into normalized cache-read usage metrics. (#25436) Thanks @Elarwei001.
- Agents/Tool dispatch: await block-reply flush before tool execution starts so buffered block replies preserve message ordering around tool calls. (#25427) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Agents/Billing classification: prevent long assistant/user-facing text from being rewritten as billing failures while preserving explicit `status/code/http 402` detection for oversized structured error payloads. (#25680, #25661) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Sessions/Tool-result guard: avoid generating synthetic `toolResult` entries for assistant turns that ended with `stopReason: "aborted"` or `"error"`, preventing orphaned tool-use IDs from triggering downstream API validation errors. (#25429) Thanks @mikaeldiakhate-cell.
- Auto-reply/Reset hooks: guarantee native `/new` and `/reset` flows emit command/reset hooks even on early-return command paths, with dedupe protection to avoid double hook emission. (#25459) Thanks @chilu18.
- Hooks/Slug generator: resolve session slug model from the agent’s effective model (including defaults/fallback resolution) instead of raw agent-primary config only. (#25485) Thanks @SudeepMalipeddi.
- Sandbox/FS bridge tests: add regression coverage for dash-leading basenames to confirm sandbox file reads resolve to absolute container paths (and avoid shell-option misdiagnosis for dashed filenames). (#25891) Thanks @albertlieyingadrian.
- Sandbox/FS bridge: build canonical-path shell scripts with newline separators (not `; ` joins) to avoid POSIX `sh` `do;` syntax errors that broke sandbox file/image read-write operations. (#25737, #25824, #25868) Thanks @DennisGoldfinger and @peteragility.
- Sandbox/Config: preserve `dangerouslyAllowReservedContainerTargets` and `dangerouslyAllowExternalBindSources` during sandbox docker config resolution so explicit bind-mount break-glass overrides reach runtime validation. (#25410) Thanks @skyer-jian.
- Gateway/Security: enforce gateway auth for the exact `/api/channels` plugin root path (plus `/api/channels/` descendants), with regression coverage for query/trailing-slash variants and near-miss paths that must remain plugin-owned. (#25753) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Exec approvals: treat bare allowlist `*` as a true wildcard for parsed executables, including unresolved PATH lookups, so global opt-in allowlists work as configured. (#25250) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- iOS/Signing: improve `scripts/ios-team-id.sh` for Xcode 16+ by falling back to Xcode-managed provisioning profiles, add actionable guidance when an Apple account exists but no Team ID can be resolved, and ignore Xcode `xcodebuild` output directories (`apps/ios/build`, `apps/shared/OpenClawKit/build`, `Swabble/build`). (#22773) Thanks @brianleach.
- Control UI/Chat images: route image-click opens through a shared safe-open helper (allowing only safe URL schemes) and open new tabs with opener isolation to block tabnabbing. (#18685, #25444, #25847) Thanks @Mariana-Codebase and @shakkernerd.
- Security/Exec: sanitize inherited host execution environment before merge, canonicalize inherited PATH handling, and strip dangerous keys (`LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, and related injection vectors) from non-sandboxed exec runs. (#25755) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Hooks: normalize hook session-key classification with trim/lowercase plus Unicode NFKC folding (for example full-width `ＨＯＯＫ：...`) so external-content wrapping cannot be bypassed by mixed-case or lookalike prefixes. (#25750) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Voice Call: add Telnyx webhook replay detection and canonicalize replay-key signature encoding (Base64/Base64URL equivalent forms dedupe together), so duplicate signed webhook deliveries no longer re-trigger side effects. (#25832) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Sandbox media: restrict sandbox media tmp-path allowances to OpenClaw-managed tmp roots instead of broad host `os.tmpdir()` trust, and add outbound/channel guardrails (tmp-path lint + media-root smoke tests) to prevent regressions in local media attachment reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox media: reject hard-linked OpenClaw tmp media aliases (including symlink-to-hardlink chains) during sandbox media path resolution to prevent out-of-sandbox inode alias reads. (#25820) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Message actions: enforce local media root checks for `sendAttachment` and `setGroupIcon` when `sandboxRoot` is unset, preventing attachment hydration from reading arbitrary host files via local absolute paths. Thanks @GCXWLP for reporting.
- Security/Telegram: enforce DM authorization before media download/write (including media groups) and move telegram inbound activity tracking after DM authorization, preventing unauthorized sender-triggered inbound media disk writes. Thanks @v8hid for reporting.
- Security/Workspace FS: normalize `@`-prefixed paths before workspace-boundary checks (including workspace-only read/write/edit and sandbox mount path guards), preventing absolute-path escape attempts from bypassing guard validation. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Synology Chat: enforce fail-closed allowlist behavior for DM ingress so `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` with empty `allowedUserIds` rejects all senders instead of allowing unauthorized dispatch. (#25827) Thanks @bmendonca3 for the contribution and @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Native images: enforce `tools.fs.workspaceOnly` for native prompt image auto-load (including history refs), preventing out-of-workspace sandbox mounts from being implicitly ingested as vision input. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: bind `system.run` command display/approval text to full argv when shell-wrapper inline payloads carry positional argv values, and reject payload-only `rawCommand` mismatches for those wrapper-carrier forms, preventing hidden command execution under misleading approval text. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec companion host: forward canonical `system.run` display text (not payload-only shell snippets) to the macOS exec host, and enforce rawCommand/argv consistency there for shell-wrapper positional-argv carriers and env-modifier preludes, preventing companion-side approval/display drift. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: fail closed when transparent dispatch-wrapper unwrapping exceeds the depth cap, so nested `/usr/bin/env` chains cannot bypass shell-wrapper approval gating in `allowlist` + `ask=on-miss` mode. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec: limit default safe-bin trusted directories to immutable system paths (`/bin`, `/usr/bin`) and require explicit opt-in (`tools.exec.safeBinTrustedDirs`) for package-manager/user bin paths (for example Homebrew), add security-audit findings for risky trusted-dir choices, warn at runtime when explicitly trusted dirs are group/world writable, and add doctor hints when configured `safeBins` resolve outside trusted dirs. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gateway/Sessions: preserve `modelProvider` on `sessions.reset` and avoid incorrect provider prefixes for legacy session models. (#25874) Thanks @lbo728.
- Agents/Compaction: harden summarization prompts to preserve opaque identifiers verbatim (UUIDs, IDs, tokens, host/IP/port, URLs), reducing post-compaction identifier drift and hallucinated identifier reconstruction.
- Security/Sandbox: canonicalize bind-mount source paths via existing-ancestor realpath so symlink-parent + non-existent-leaf paths cannot bypass allowed-source-roots or blocked-path checks. Thanks @tdjackey.

## 2026.2.23

### Changes

- Providers/Kilo Gateway: add first-class `kilocode` provider support (auth, onboarding, implicit provider detection, model defaults, transcript/cache-ttl handling, and docs), with default model `kilocode/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`. (#20212) Thanks @jrf0110 and @markijbema.
- Providers/Vercel AI Gateway: accept Claude shorthand model refs (`vercel-ai-gateway/claude-*`) by normalizing to canonical Anthropic-routed model ids. (#23985) Thanks @sallyom, @markbooch, and @vincentkoc.
- Docs/Prompt caching: add a dedicated prompt-caching reference covering `cacheRetention`, per-agent `params` merge precedence, Bedrock/OpenRouter behavior, and cache-ttl + heartbeat tuning. Thanks @svenssonaxel.
- Gateway/HTTP security headers: add optional `gateway.http.securityHeaders.strictTransportSecurity` support to emit `Strict-Transport-Security` for direct HTTPS deployments, with runtime wiring, validation, tests, and hardening docs.
- Sessions/Cron: harden session maintenance with `openclaw sessions cleanup`, per-agent store targeting, disk-budget controls (`session.maintenance.maxDiskBytes` / `highWaterBytes`), and safer transcript/archive cleanup + run-log retention behavior. (#24753) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Tools/web_search: add `provider: "kimi"` (Moonshot) support with key/config schema wiring and a corrected two-step `$web_search` tool flow that echoes tool results before final synthesis, including citation extraction from search results. (#16616, #18822) Thanks @adshine.
- Media understanding/Video: add a native Moonshot video provider and include Moonshot in auto video key detection, plus refactor video execution to honor `entry/config/provider` baseUrl+header precedence (matching audio behavior). (#12063) Thanks @xiaoyaner0201.
- Agents/Config: support per-agent `params` overrides merged on top of model defaults (including `cacheRetention`) so mixed-traffic agents can tune cache behavior independently. (#17470, #17112) Thanks @rrenamed.
- Agents/Bootstrap: cache bootstrap file snapshots per session key and clear them on session reset/delete, reducing prompt-cache invalidations from in-session `AGENTS.md`/`MEMORY.md` writes. (#22220) Thanks @anisoptera.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** browser SSRF policy now defaults to trusted-network mode (`browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork=true` when unset), and canonical config uses `browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork` instead of `browser.ssrfPolicy.allowPrivateNetwork`. `openclaw doctor --fix` migrates the legacy key automatically.

### Fixes

- Security/Config: redact sensitive-looking dynamic catchall keys in `config.get` snapshots (for example `env.*` and `skills.entries.*.env.*`) and preserve round-trip restore behavior for those redacted sentinels. Thanks @merc1305.
- Tests/Vitest: tier local parallel worker defaults by host memory, keep gateway serial by default on non-high-memory hosts, and document a low-profile fallback command for memory-constrained land/gate runs to prevent local OOMs. (#24719) Thanks @ngutman.
- WhatsApp/Group policy: fix `groupAllowFrom` sender filtering when `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` is set without explicit `groups` — previously all group messages were blocked even for allowlisted senders. (#24670) Thanks @lailoo.
- Agents/Context pruning: extend `cache-ttl` eligibility to Moonshot/Kimi and ZAI/GLM providers (including OpenRouter model refs), so `contextPruning.mode: "cache-ttl"` is no longer silently skipped for those sessions. (#24497) Thanks @lailoo.
- Doctor/Memory: query gateway-side default-agent memory embedding readiness during `openclaw doctor` (instead of inferring from generic gateway health), and warn when the gateway memory probe is unavailable or not ready while keeping `openclaw configure` remediation guidance. (#22327) thanks @therk.
- Sessions/Store: canonicalize inbound mixed-case session keys for metadata and route updates, and migrate legacy case-variant entries to a single lowercase key to prevent duplicate sessions and missing TUI/WebUI history. (#9561) Thanks @hillghost86.
- Telegram/Reactions: soft-fail reaction action errors (policy/token/emoji/API), accept snake_case `message_id`, and fallback to inbound message-id context when explicit `messageId` is omitted so DM reactions stay stable without regeneration loops. (#20236, #21001) Thanks @PeterShanxin and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Polling: scope persisted polling offsets to bot identity and reuse a single awaited runner-stop path on abort/retry, preventing cross-token offset bleed and overlapping pollers during restart/error recovery. (#10850, #11347) Thanks @talhaorak, @anooprdawar, and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Reasoning: when `/reasoning off` is active, suppress reasoning-only delivery segments and block raw fallback resend of suppressed `Reasoning:`/`<think>` text, preventing internal reasoning leakage in legacy sessions while preserving answer delivery. (#24626, #24518)
- Agents/Reasoning: when model-default thinking is active (for example `thinking=low`), keep auto-reasoning disabled unless explicitly enabled, preventing `Reasoning:` thinking-block leakage in channel replies. (#24335, #24290) thanks @Kay-051.
- Agents/Reasoning: avoid classifying provider reasoning-required errors as context overflows so these failures no longer trigger compaction-style overflow recovery. (#24593) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Models: codify `agents.defaults.model` / `agents.defaults.imageModel` config-boundary input as `string | {primary,fallbacks}`, split explicit vs effective model resolution, and fix `models status --agent` source attribution so defaults-inherited agents are labeled as `defaults` while runtime selection still honors defaults fallback. (#24210) thanks @bianbiandashen.
- Agents/Compaction: pass `agentDir` into manual `/compact` command runs so compaction auth/profile resolution stays scoped to the active agent. (#24133) thanks @miloudbelarebia.
- Agents/Compaction: pass model metadata through the embedded runtime so safeguard summarization can run when `ctx.model` is unavailable, avoiding repeated `"Summary unavailable due to context limits"` fallback summaries. (#3479) Thanks @battman21, @hanxiao and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: cancel safeguard compaction when summary generation cannot run (missing model/API key or summarization failure), preserving history instead of truncating to fallback `"Summary unavailable"` text. (#10711) Thanks @DukeDeSouth and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Tools: make `session_status` read transcript-derived usage mid-turn and tail-read session logs for cache-aware context reporting without full-log scans. (#22387) Thanks @1ucian.
- Agents/Overflow: detect additional provider context-overflow error shapes (including `input length` + `max_tokens` exceed-context variants) so failures route through compaction/recovery paths instead of leaking raw provider errors to users. (#9951) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Overflow: add Chinese context-overflow pattern detection in `isContextOverflowError` so localized provider errors route through overflow recovery paths. (#22855) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Agents/Failover: treat HTTP 502/503/504 errors as failover-eligible transient timeouts so fallback chains can switch providers/models during upstream outages instead of retrying the same failing target. (#20999) Thanks @taw0002 and @vincentkoc.
- Auto-reply/Inbound metadata: hide direct-chat `message_id`/`message_id_full` and sender metadata only from normalized chat type (not sender-id sentinels), preserving group metadata visibility and preventing sender-id spoofed direct-mode classification. (#24373) thanks @jd316.
- Auto-reply/Inbound metadata: move dynamic inbound `flags` (reply/forward/thread/history) from system metadata to user-context conversation info, preventing turn-by-turn prompt-cache invalidation from flag toggles. (#21785) Thanks @aidiffuser.
- Auto-reply/Sessions: remove auth-key labels from `/new` and `/reset` confirmation messages so session reset notices never expose API key prefixes or env-key labels in chat output. (#24384, #24409) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Slack/Group policy: move Slack account `groupPolicy` defaulting to provider-level schema defaults so multi-account configs inherit top-level `channels.slack.groupPolicy` instead of silently overriding inheritance with per-account `allowlist`. (#17579) Thanks @ZetiMente.
- Providers/Anthropic: skip `context-1m-*` beta injection for OAuth/subscription tokens (`sk-ant-oat-*`) while preserving OAuth-required betas, avoiding Anthropic 401 auth failures when `params.context1m` is enabled. (#10647, #20354) Thanks @ClumsyWizardHands and @dcruver.
- Providers/DashScope: mark DashScope-compatible `openai-completions` endpoints as `supportsDeveloperRole=false` so OpenClaw sends `system` instead of unsupported `developer` role on Qwen/DashScope APIs. (#19130) Thanks @Putzhuawa and @vincentkoc.
- Providers/Bedrock: disable prompt-cache retention for non-Anthropic Bedrock models so Nova/Mistral requests do not send unsupported cache metadata. (#20866) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Providers/Bedrock: apply Anthropic-Claude cacheRetention defaults and runtime pass-through for `amazon-bedrock/*anthropic.claude*` model refs, while keeping non-Anthropic Bedrock models excluded. (#22303) Thanks @snese.
- Providers/OpenRouter: remove conflicting top-level `reasoning_effort` when injecting nested `reasoning.effort`, preventing OpenRouter 400 payload-validation failures for reasoning models. (#24120) thanks @tenequm.
- Plugins/Install: when npm install returns 404 for bundled channel npm specs, fallback to bundled channel sources and complete install/enable persistence instead of failing plugin install. (#12849) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Gemini OAuth/Auth: resolve npm global shim install layouts while discovering Gemini CLI credentials, preventing false "Gemini CLI not found" onboarding/auth failures when shim paths are on `PATH`. (#27585) Thanks @ehgamemo and @vincentkoc.
- Providers/Groq: avoid classifying Groq TPM limit errors as context overflow so throttling paths no longer trigger overflow recovery logic. (#16176) Thanks @dddabtc.
- Gateway/Restart: treat child listener PIDs as owned by the service runtime PID during restart health checks to avoid false stale-process kills and restart timeouts on launchd/systemd. (#24696) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Config/Write: apply `unsetPaths` with immutable path-copy updates so config writes never mutate caller-provided objects, and harden `openclaw config get/set/unset` path traversal by rejecting prototype-key segments and inherited-property traversal. (#24134) thanks @frankekn.
- Channels/WhatsApp: accept `channels.whatsapp.enabled` in config validation to match built-in channel auto-enable behavior, preventing `Unrecognized key: "enabled"` failures during channel setup. (#24263) Thanks @steipete.
- Security/Exec: detect obfuscated commands before exec allowlist decisions and require explicit approval for obfuscation patterns. (#8592) Thanks @CornBrother0x and @vincentkoc.
- Security/ACP: harden ACP client permission auto-approval to require trusted core tool IDs, ignore untrusted `toolCall.kind` hints, and scope `read` auto-approval to the active working directory so unknown tool names and out-of-scope file reads always prompt. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Skills: escape user-controlled prompt, filename, and output-path values in `openai-image-gen` HTML gallery generation to prevent stored XSS in generated `index.html` output. (#12538) Thanks @CornBrother0x.
- Security/Skills: harden `skill-creator` packaging by skipping symlink entries and rejecting files whose resolved paths escape the selected skill root. (#24260, #16959) Thanks @CornBrother0x and @vincentkoc.
- Security/OTEL: redact sensitive values (API keys, tokens, credential fields) from diagnostics-otel log bodies, log attributes, and error/reason span fields before OTLP export. (#12542) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Security/CI: add pre-commit security hook coverage for private-key detection and production dependency auditing, and enforce those checks in CI alongside baseline secret scanning. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Skills/Python: harden skill script packaging and validation edge cases (self-including `.skill` outputs, CRLF frontmatter parsing, strict `--days` validation, and safer image file loading), with expanded Python regression coverage. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Skills/Python: add CI + pre-commit linting (`ruff`) and pytest discovery coverage for Python scripts/tests under `skills/`, including package test execution from repo root. Thanks @vincentkoc.

## 2026.2.22

### Changes

- Control UI/Agents: make the Tools panel data-driven from runtime `tools.catalog`, add per-tool provenance labels (`core` / `plugin:<id>` + optional marker), and keep a static fallback list when the runtime catalog is unavailable.
- Web Search/Gemini: add grounded Gemini provider support with provider auto-detection and config/docs updates. (#13075, #13074) Thanks @akoscz.
- Control UI/Cron: add full web cron edit parity (including clone and richer validation/help text), plus all-jobs run history with pagination/search/sort/multi-filter controls and improved cron page layout for cleaner scheduling and failure triage workflows.
- Provider/Mistral: add support for the Mistral provider, including memory embeddings and voice support. (#23845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Update/Core: add an optional built-in auto-updater for package installs (`update.auto.*`), default-off, with stable rollout delay+jitter and beta hourly cadence.
- CLI/Update: add `openclaw update --dry-run` to preview channel/tag/target/restart actions without mutating config, installing, syncing plugins, or restarting.
- Config/UI: add tag-aware settings filtering and broaden config labels/help copy so fields are easier to discover and understand in the dashboard config screen.
- Channels/Synology Chat: add a native Synology Chat channel plugin with webhook ingress, direct-message routing, outbound send/media support, per-account config, and DM policy controls. (#23012) Thanks @steipete.
- iOS/Talk: prefetch TTS segments and suppress expected speech-cancellation errors for smoother talk playback. (#22833) Thanks @ngutman.
- Memory/FTS: add Spanish and Portuguese stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode, improving conversational recall for both languages. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Japanese-aware query expansion tokenization and stop-word filtering (including mixed-script terms like ASCII + katakana) for FTS-only search mode. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Korean stop-word filtering and particle-aware keyword extraction (including mixed Korean/English stems) for query expansion in FTS-only search mode. (#18899) Thanks @ruypang.
- Memory/FTS: add Arabic stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode to reduce conversational filler in Arabic memory searches. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Discord/Allowlist: canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs and split resolution flow for clearer fail-closed behavior.
- Channels/Config: unify channel preview streaming config handling with a shared resolver and canonical migration path.
- Gateway/Auth: unify call/probe/status/auth credential-source precedence on shared resolver helpers, with table-driven parity coverage across gateway entrypoints.
- Gateway/Auth: refactor gateway credential resolution and websocket auth handshake paths to use shared typed auth contexts, including explicit `auth.deviceToken` support in connect frames and tests.
- Skills: remove bundled `food-order` skill from this repo; manage/install it from ClawHub instead.
- Docs/Subagents: make thread-bound session guidance channel-first instead of Discord-specific, and list thread-supporting channels explicitly. (#23589) Thanks @osolmaz.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** removed Google Antigravity provider support and the bundled `google-antigravity-auth` plugin. Existing `google-antigravity/*` model/profile configs no longer work; migrate to `google-gemini-cli` or other supported providers.
- **BREAKING:** tool-failure replies now hide raw error details by default. OpenClaw still sends a failure summary, but detailed error suffixes (for example provider/runtime messages and local path fragments) now require `/verbose on` or `/verbose full`.
- **BREAKING:** CLI local onboarding now sets `session.dmScope` to `per-channel-peer` by default for new/implicit DM scope configuration. If you depend on shared DM continuity across senders, explicitly set `session.dmScope` to `main`. (#23468) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- **BREAKING:** unify channel preview-streaming config to `channels.<channel>.streaming` with enum values `off | partial | block | progress`, and move Slack native stream toggle to `channels.slack.nativeStreaming`. Legacy keys (`streamMode`, Slack boolean `streaming`) are still read and migrated by `openclaw doctor --fix`, but canonical saved config/docs now use the unified names.
- **BREAKING:** remove legacy Gateway device-auth signature `v1`. Device-auth clients must now sign `v2` payloads with the per-connection `connect.challenge` nonce and send `device.nonce`; nonce-less connects are rejected.

### Fixes

- Sessions/Resilience: ignore invalid persisted `sessionFile` metadata and fall back to the derived safe transcript path instead of aborting session resolution for handlers and tooling. (#16061) Thanks @haoyifan and @vincentkoc.
- Sessions/Paths: resolve symlinked state-dir aliases during transcript-path validation while preserving safe cross-agent/state-root compatibility for valid `agents/<id>/sessions/**` paths. (#18593) Thanks @EpaL and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: count auto-compactions only after a non-retry `auto_compaction_end`, keeping session `compactionCount` aligned to completed compactions.
- Security/CLI: redact sensitive values in `openclaw config get` output before printing config paths, preventing credential leakage to terminal output/history. (#13683) Thanks @SleuthCo.
- Agents/Moonshot: force `supportsDeveloperRole=false` for Moonshot-compatible `openai-completions` models (provider `moonshot` and Moonshot base URLs), so initial runs no longer send unsupported `developer` roles that trigger `ROLE_UNSPECIFIED` errors. (#21060, #22194) Thanks @ShengFuC.
- Agents/Kimi: classify Moonshot `Your request exceeded model token limit` failures as context overflows so auto-compaction and user-facing overflow recovery trigger correctly instead of surfacing raw invalid-request errors. (#9562) Thanks @danilofalcao.
- Providers/Moonshot: mark Kimi K2.5 as image-capable in implicit + onboarding model definitions, and refresh stale explicit provider capability fields (`input`/`reasoning`/context limits) from implicit catalogs so existing configs pick up Moonshot vision support without manual model rewrites. (#13135, #4459) Thanks @manikv12.
- Agents/Transcript: enable consecutive-user turn merging for strict non-OpenAI `openai-completions` providers (for example Moonshot/Kimi), reducing `roles must alternate` ordering failures on OpenAI-compatible endpoints while preserving current OpenRouter/Opencode behavior. (#7693) Thanks @steipete.
- Install/Discord Voice: make the native Opus decoder optional so `openclaw` install/update no longer hard-fails when native builds fail, while keeping `opusscript` as the runtime fallback decoder for Discord voice flows. (#23737, #23733, #23703) Thanks @jeadland, @Sheetaa, and @Breakyman.
- Docker/Setup: precreate `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR/identity` during `docker-setup.sh` so CLI commands that need device identity (for example `devices list`) avoid `EACCES ... /home/node/.openclaw/identity` failures on restrictive bind mounts. (#23948) Thanks @ackson-beep.
- Exec/Background: stop applying the default exec timeout to background sessions (`background: true` or explicit `yieldMs`) when no explicit timeout is set, so long-running background jobs are no longer terminated at the default timeout boundary. (#23303) Thanks @steipete.
- Slack/Threading: sessions: keep parent-session forking and thread-history context active beyond first turn by removing first-turn-only gates in session init, thread-history fetch, and reply prompt context injection. (#23843, #23090) Thanks @vincentkoc and @Taskle.
- Slack/Threading: respect `replyToMode` when Slack auto-populates top-level `thread_ts`, and ignore inline `replyToId` directive tags when `replyToMode` is `off` so thread forcing stays disabled unless explicitly configured. (#23839, #23320, #23513) Thanks @vincentkoc and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Extension: forward `message read` `threadId` to `readMessages` and use delivery-context `threadId` as outbound `thread_ts` fallback so extension replies/reads stay in the correct Slack thread. (#22216, #22485, #23836) Thanks @vincentkoc, @lan17 and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Upload: resolve bare user IDs (U-prefix) to DM channel IDs via `conversations.open`, and replace `files.uploadV2` with Slack’s external 3-step upload flow (`files.getUploadURLExternal` → presigned upload POST → `files.completeUploadExternal`) to avoid `missing_scope`/`invalid_arguments` upload failures in DM and threaded media replies.
- Webchat/Chat: apply assistant `final` payload messages directly to chat state so sent turns render without waiting for a full history refresh cycle. (#14928) Thanks @BradGroux.
- Webchat/Chat: for out-of-band final events (for example tool-call side runs), append provided final assistant payloads directly instead of forcing a transient history reset. (#11139) Thanks @AkshayNavle.
- Webchat/Performance: reload `chat.history` after final events only when the final payload lacks a renderable assistant message, avoiding expensive full-history refreshes on normal turns. (#20588) Thanks @amzzzzzzz.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve external session routing metadata when internal `chat.send` turns run under `webchat`, so explicit channel-keyed sessions (for example Telegram) no longer get rewritten to `webchat` and misroute follow-up delivery. (#23258) Thanks @binary64.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve existing session `label` across `/new` and `/reset` rollovers so reset sessions remain discoverable in session history lists. (#23755) Thanks @ThunderStormer.
- Gateway/Chat UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags from non-streaming final webchat broadcasts (including `chat.inject`) while preserving empty-string message content when tags are the entire reply. (#23298) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Chat/UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags (`[[reply_to_current]]`, `[[reply_to:<id>]]`, `[[audio_as_voice]]`) from displayed chat history, live chat event output, and session preview snippets so control tags no longer leak into user-visible surfaces.
- Gateway/Chat UI: sanitize non-streaming final `chat.send`/`chat.inject` payload text with the same envelope/untrusted-context stripping used by `chat.history`, preventing `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT...>>>` wrapper markup from rendering in Control UI chat. (#24012) Thanks @mittelaltergouda.
- Telegram/Media: send a user-facing Telegram reply when media download fails (non-size errors) instead of silently dropping the message.
- Telegram/Webhook: keep webhook monitors alive until gateway abort signals fire, preventing false channel exits and immediate webhook auto-restart loops.
- Telegram/Polling: retry recoverable setup-time network failures in monitor startup and await runner teardown before retry to avoid overlapping polling sessions.
- Telegram/Polling: clear Telegram webhooks (`deleteWebhook`) before starting long-poll `getUpdates`, including retry handling for transient cleanup failures.
- Telegram/Webhook: add `channels.telegram.webhookPort` config support and pass it through plugin startup wiring to the monitor listener.
- Browser/Extension Relay: refactor the MV3 worker to preserve debugger attachments across relay drops, auto-reconnect with bounded backoff+jitter, persist and rehydrate attached tab state via `chrome.storage.session`, recover from `target_closed` navigation detaches, guard stale socket handlers, enforce per-tab operation locks and per-request timeouts, and add lifecycle keepalive/badge refresh hooks (`alarms`, `webNavigation`). (#15099, #6175, #8468, #9807)
- Browser/Relay: treat extension websocket as connected only when `OPEN`, allow reconnect when a stale `CLOSING/CLOSED` extension socket lingers, and guard stale socket message/close handlers so late events cannot clear active relay state; includes regression coverage for live-duplicate `409` rejection and immediate reconnect-after-close races. (#15099, #18698, #20688)
- Browser/Remote CDP: extend stale-target recovery so `ensureTabAvailable()` now reuses the sole available tab for remote CDP profiles (same behavior as extension profiles) while preserving strict `tab not found` errors when multiple tabs exist; includes remote-profile regression tests. (#15989) Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/Pairing: treat `operator.admin` as satisfying other `operator.*` scope checks during device-auth verification so local CLI/TUI sessions stop entering pairing-required loops for pairing/approval-scoped commands. (#22062, #22193, #21191) Thanks @Botaccess, @jhartshorn, and @ctbritt.
- Gateway/Pairing: auto-approve loopback `scope-upgrade` pairing requests (including device-token reconnects) so local clients do not disconnect on pairing-required scope elevation. (#23708) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Gateway/Scopes: include `operator.read` and `operator.write` in default operator connect scope bundles across CLI, Control UI, and macOS clients so write-scoped announce/sub-agent follow-up calls no longer hit `pairing required` disconnects on loopback gateways. (#22582) thanks @YuzuruS.
- Gateway/Pairing: treat operator.admin pairing tokens as satisfying operator.write requests so legacy devices stop looping through scope-upgrade prompts introduced in 2026.2.19. (#23125, #23006) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Gateway/Restart: fix restart-loop edge cases by keeping `openclaw.mjs -> dist/entry.js` bootstrap detection explicit, reacquiring the gateway lock for in-process restart fallback paths, and tightening restart-loop regression coverage. (#23416) Thanks @jeffwnli.
- Gateway/Lock: use optional gateway-port reachability as a primary stale-lock liveness signal (and wire gateway run-loop lock acquisition to the resolved port), reducing false "already running" lockouts after unclean exits. (#23760) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Delivery/Queue: quarantine queue entries immediately on known permanent delivery errors (for example invalid recipients or missing conversation references) by moving them to `failed/` instead of retrying on every restart. (#23794) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Cron/Status: split execution outcome (`lastRunStatus`) from delivery outcome (`lastDeliveryStatus`) in persisted cron state, finished events, and run history so failed/unknown announcement delivery is visible without conflating it with run errors.
- Cron/Delivery: route text-only announce jobs with explicit thread/topic targets through direct outbound delivery so forum/thread destinations do not get dropped by intermediary announce turns. (#23841) Thanks @AndrewArto.
- Cron: honor `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` in the timer loop so due jobs can execute up to the configured parallelism instead of always running serially. (#11595) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Cron/Run: enforce the same per-job timeout guard for manual `cron.run` executions as timer-driven runs, including abort propagation for isolated agent jobs, so forced runs cannot wedge indefinitely. (#23704) Thanks @tkuehnl.
- Cron/Run: persist the manual-run `runningAtMs` marker before releasing the cron lock so overlapping timer ticks cannot start the same job concurrently.
- Cron/Startup: enforce per-job timeout guards for startup catch-up replay runs so missed isolated jobs cannot hang indefinitely during gateway boot recovery.
- Cron/Main session: honor abort/timeout signals while retrying `wakeMode=now` heartbeat contention loops so main-target cron runs stop promptly instead of waiting through the full busy-retry window.
- Cron/Schedule: for `every` jobs, prefer `lastRunAtMs + everyMs` when still in the future after restarts, then fall back to anchor scheduling for catch-up windows, so NEXT timing matches the last successful cadence. (#22895) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Cron/Service: execute manual `cron.run` jobs outside the cron lock (while still persisting started/finished state atomically) so `cron.list` and `cron.status` remain responsive during long forced runs. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Timer: keep a watchdog recheck timer armed while `onTimer` is actively executing so the scheduler continues polling even if a due-run tick stalls for an extended period. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Run log: clean up settled per-path run-log write queue entries so long-running cron uptime does not retain stale promise bookkeeping in memory.
- Cron/Run log: harden `cron.runs` run-log path resolution by rejecting path-separator `id`/`jobId` inputs and enforcing reads within the per-cron `runs/` directory.
- Cron/Announce: when announce delivery target resolution fails (for example multiple configured channels with no explicit target), skip injecting fallback `Cron (error): ...` into the main session so runs fail cleanly without accidental last-route sends. (#24074) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Cron/Telegram: validate cron `delivery.to` with shared Telegram target parsing and resolve legacy `@username`/`t.me` targets to numeric IDs at send-time for deterministic delivery target writeback. (#21930) Thanks @kesor.
- Telegram/Targets: normalize unprefixed topic-qualified targets through the shared parse/normalize path so valid `@channel:topic:<id>` and `<chatId>:topic:<id>` routes are recognized again. (#24166) Thanks @obviyus.
- Cron/Isolation: force fresh session IDs for isolated cron runs so `sessionTarget="isolated"` executions never reuse prior run context. (#23470) Thanks @echoVic.
- Plugins/Install: strip `workspace:*` devDependency entries from copied plugin manifests before `npm install --omit=dev`, preventing `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` install failures for npm-published channel plugins (including Feishu and MS Teams).
- Feishu/Plugins: restore bundled Feishu SDK availability for global installs and strip `openclaw: workspace:*` from plugin `devDependencies` during plugin-version sync so npm-installed Feishu plugins do not fail dependency install. (#23611, #23645, #23603)
- Config/Channels: auto-enable built-in channels by writing `channels.<id>.enabled=true` (not `plugins.entries.<id>`), and stop adding built-ins to `plugins.allow`, preventing `plugins.entries.telegram: plugin not found` validation failures.
- Config/Channels: when `plugins.allow` is active, auto-enable/enable flows now also allowlist configured built-in channels so `channels.<id>.enabled=true` cannot remain blocked by restrictive plugin allowlists.
- Plugins/Discovery: ignore scanned extension backup/disabled directory patterns (for example `.backup-*`, `.bak`, `.disabled*`) and move updater backup directories under `.openclaw-install-backups`, preventing duplicate plugin-id collisions from archived copies.
- Plugins/CLI: make `openclaw plugins enable` and plugin install/link flows update allowlists via shared plugin-enable policy so enabled plugins are not left disabled by allowlist mismatch. (#23190) Thanks @downwind7clawd-ctrl.
- Security/Voice Call: harden media stream WebSocket handling against pre-auth idle-connection DoS by adding strict pre-start timeouts, pending/per-IP connection limits, and total connection caps for streaming endpoints. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Sessions: redact sensitive token patterns from `sessions_history` tool output and surface `contentRedacted` metadata when masking occurs. (#16928) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Exec: stop trusting `PATH`-derived directories for safe-bin allowlist checks, add explicit `tools.exec.safeBinTrustedDirs`, and pin safe-bin shell execution to resolved absolute executable paths to prevent binary-shadowing approval bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Elevated: match `tools.elevated.allowFrom` against sender identities only (not recipient `ctx.To`), closing a recipient-token bypass for `/elevated` authorization. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: enforce ID-only allowlist matching for DM/group sender authorization, normalize Feishu ID prefixes during checks, and ignore mutable display names so display-name collisions cannot satisfy allowlist entries. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Group policy: harden `channels.*.groups.*.toolsBySender` matching by requiring explicit sender-key types (`id:`, `e164:`, `username:`, `name:`), preventing cross-identifier collisions across mutable/display-name fields while keeping legacy untyped keys on a deprecated ID-only path. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Channels/Group policy: fail closed when `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` is set without explicit `groups`, honor account-level `groupPolicy` overrides, and enforce `groupPolicy: "disabled"` as a hard group block. (#22215) Thanks @etereo.
- Telegram/Discord extensions: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through extension outbound `sendMedia` options so extension direct-send media paths honor agent-scoped local-media allowlists. (#20029, #21903, #23227)
- Agents/Exec: honor explicit agent context when resolving `tools.exec` defaults for runs with opaque/non-agent session keys, so per-agent `host/security/ask` policies are applied consistently. (#11832) Thanks @steipete.
- CLI/Sessions: resolve implicit session-store path templates with the configured default agent ID so named-agent setups do not silently read/write stale `agent:main` session/auth stores. (#22685) Thanks @sene1337.
- Doctor/Security: add an explicit warning that `approvals.exec.enabled=false` disables forwarding only, while enforcement remains driven by host-local `exec-approvals.json` policy. (#15047) Thanks @steipete.
- Sandbox/Docker: default sandbox container user to the workspace owner `uid:gid` when `agents.*.sandbox.docker.user` is unset, fixing non-root gateway file-tool permissions under capability-dropped containers. (#20979) Thanks @steipete.
- Plugins/Media sandbox: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through plugin action dispatch (including Discord/Telegram action adapters) so plugin send paths enforce the same agent-scoped local-media sandbox roots as core outbound sends. (#20258, #22718)
- Agents/Workspace guard: map sandbox container-workdir file-tool paths (for example `/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) to host workspace roots before workspace-only validation, preventing false `Path escapes sandbox root` rejections for sandbox file tools. (#9560) Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/Exec approvals: expire approval requests immediately when no approval-capable gateway clients are connected and no forwarding targets are available, avoiding delayed approvals after restarts/offline approver windows. (#22144) Thanks @steipete.
- Security/Exec approvals: when approving wrapper commands with allow-always in allowlist mode, persist inner executable paths for known dispatch wrappers (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout`) and fail closed (no persisted entry) when wrapper unwrapping is not safe, preventing wrapper-path approval bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Node/macOS exec host: default headless macOS node `system.run` to local execution and only route through the companion app when `OPENCLAW_NODE_EXEC_HOST=app` is explicitly set, avoiding companion-app filesystem namespace mismatches during exec. (#23547) Thanks @steipete.
- Sandbox/Media: map container workspace paths (`/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) back to the host sandbox root for outbound media validation, preventing false deny errors for sandbox-generated local media. (#23083) Thanks @echo931.
- Sandbox/Docker: apply custom bind mounts after workspace mounts and prioritize bind-source resolution on overlapping paths, so explicit workspace binds are no longer ignored. (#22669) Thanks @tasaankaeris.
- Exec approvals/Forwarding: restore Discord text forwarding when component approvals are not configured, and carry request snapshots through resolve events so resolved notices still forward after cache misses/restarts. (#22988) Thanks @bubmiller.
- Control UI/WebSocket: stop and clear the browser gateway client on UI teardown so remounts cannot leave orphan websocket clients that create duplicate active connections. (#23422) Thanks @floatinggball-design.
- Control UI/WebSocket: send a stable per-tab `instanceId` in websocket connect frames so reconnect cycles keep a consistent client identity for diagnostics and presence tracking. (#23616) Thanks @zq58855371-ui.
- Config/Memory: allow `"mistral"` in `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider` and `agents.defaults.memorySearch.fallback` schema validation. (#14934) Thanks @ThomsenDrake.
- Feishu/Commands: in group chats, command authorization now falls back to top-level `channels.feishu.allowFrom` when per-group `allowFrom` is not set, so `/command` no longer gets blocked by an unintended empty allowlist. (#23756) Thanks @steipete.
- Dev tooling: prevent `CLAUDE.md` symlink target regressions by excluding CLAUDE symlink sentinels from `oxfmt` and marking them `-text` in `.gitattributes`, so formatter/EOL normalization cannot reintroduce trailing-newline targets. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: restore embedded compaction safeguard/context-pruning extension loading in production by wiring bundled extension factories into the resource loader instead of runtime file-path resolution. (#22349; landed from contributor PR #5005 by @Diaspar4u) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Feishu/Media: for inbound video messages that include both `file_key` (video) and `image_key` (thumbnail), prefer `file_key` when downloading media so video attachments are saved instead of silently failing on thumbnail keys. (#23633) Thanks @steipete.
- Hooks/Loader: avoid redundant hook-module recompilation on gateway restart by skipping cache-busting for bundled hooks and using stable file metadata keys (`mtime+size`) for mutable workspace/managed/plugin hook imports. (#16953) Thanks @mudrii.
- Hooks/Cron: suppress duplicate main-session events for delivered hook turns and mark `SILENT_REPLY_TOKEN` (`NO_REPLY`) early exits as delivered to prevent hook context pollution. (#20678) Thanks @JonathanWorks.
- Providers/OpenRouter: inject `cache_control` on system prompts for OpenRouter Anthropic models to improve prompt-cache reuse. (#17473) Thanks @rrenamed.
- Installer/Smoke tests: remove legacy `OPENCLAW_USE_GUM` overrides from docker install-smoke runs so tests exercise installer auto TTY detection behavior directly.
- Providers/OpenRouter: allow pass-through OpenRouter and Opencode model IDs in live model filtering so custom routed model IDs are treated as modern refs. (#14312) Thanks @Joly0.
- Providers/OpenRouter: default reasoning to enabled when the selected model advertises `reasoning: true` and no session/directive override is set. (#22513) Thanks @zwffff.
- Providers/OpenRouter: map `/think` levels to `reasoning.effort` in embedded runs while preserving explicit `reasoning.max_tokens` payloads. (#17236) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve stored session provider when model IDs are vendor-prefixed (for example, `anthropic/...`) so follow-up turns do not incorrectly route to direct provider APIs. (#22753) Thanks @dndodson.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve the required `openrouter/` prefix for OpenRouter-native model IDs during model-ref normalization. (#12942) Thanks @omair445.
- Providers/OpenRouter: pass through provider routing parameters from model params.provider to OpenRouter request payloads for provider selection controls. (#17148) Thanks @carrotRakko.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve model allowlist entries containing OpenRouter preset paths (for example `openrouter/@preset/...`) by treating `/model ...@profile` auth-profile parsing as a suffix-only override. (#14120) Thanks @NotMainstream.
- Cron/Auth: propagate auth-profile resolution to isolated cron sessions so provider API keys are resolved the same way as main sessions, fixing 401 errors when using providers configured via auth-profiles. (#20689) Thanks @lailoo.
- Cron/Follow-up: pass resolved `agentDir` through isolated cron and queued follow-up embedded runs so auth/profile lookups stay scoped to the correct agent directory. (#22845) Thanks @seilk.
- Agents/Media: route tool-result `MEDIA:` extraction through shared parser validation so malformed prose like `MEDIA:-prefixed ...` is no longer treated as a local file path (prevents Telegram ENOENT tool-error overrides). (#18780) Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Logging: cap single log-file size with `logging.maxFileBytes` (default 500 MB) and suppress additional writes after cap hit to prevent disk exhaustion from repeated error storms.
- Memory/Remote HTTP: centralize remote memory HTTP calls behind a shared guarded helper (`withRemoteHttpResponse`) so embeddings and batch flows use one request/release path.
- Memory/Embeddings: apply configured remote-base host pinning (`allowedHostnames`) across OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini embedding requests to keep private/self-hosted endpoints working without cross-host drift. (#18198) Thanks @ianpcook.
- Memory/Batch: route OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini batch upload/create/status/download requests through the same guarded HTTP path for consistent SSRF policy enforcement.
- Memory/Index: detect memory source-set changes (for example enabling `sessions` after an existing memory-only index) and trigger a full reindex so existing session transcripts are indexed without requiring `--force`. (#17576) Thanks @TarsAI-Agent.
- Memory/Embeddings: enforce a per-input 8k safety cap before embedding batching and apply a conservative 2k fallback limit for local providers without declared input limits, preventing oversized session/memory chunks from triggering provider context-size failures during sync/indexing. (#6016) Thanks @batumilove.
- Memory/QMD: on Windows, resolve bare `qmd`/`mcporter` command names to npm shim executables (`.cmd`) before spawning, so qmd boot updates and mcporter-backed searches no longer fail with `spawn ... ENOENT` on default npm installs. (#23899) Thanks @arcbuilder-ai.
- Memory/QMD: parse plain-text `qmd collection list --json` output when older qmd builds ignore JSON mode, and retry memory searches once after re-ensuring managed collections when qmd returns `Collection not found ...`. (#23613) Thanks @leozhucn.
- iOS/Watch: normalize watch quick-action notification payloads, support mirrored indexed actions beyond primary/secondary, and fix iOS test-target signing/compile blockers for watch notify coverage. (#23636) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Signal/RPC: guard malformed Signal RPC JSON responses with a clear status-scoped error and add regression coverage for invalid JSON responses. (#22995) Thanks @adhitShet.
- Gateway/Subagents: guard gateway and subagent session-key/message trim paths against undefined inputs to prevent early `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes during subagent spawn and wait flows.
- Agents/Workspace: guard `resolveUserPath` against undefined/null input to prevent `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes when workspace paths are missing in embedded runner flows.
- Auth/Profiles: keep active `cooldownUntil`/`disabledUntil` windows immutable across retries so mid-window failures cannot extend recovery indefinitely; only recompute a backoff window after the previous deadline has expired. This resolves cron/inbound retry loops that could trap gateways until manual `usageStats` cleanup. (#23516, #23536) Thanks @arosstale.
- Channels/Security: fail closed on missing provider group policy config by defaulting runtime group policy to `allowlist` (instead of inheriting `channels.defaults.groupPolicy`) when `channels.<provider>` is absent across message channels, and align runtime + security warnings/docs to the same fallback behavior (Slack, Discord, iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Matrix, Mattermost, Google Chat, IRC, Nextcloud Talk, Feishu, and Zalo user flows; plus Discord message/native-command paths). (#23367) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Gateway/Onboarding: harden remote gateway onboarding defaults and guidance by defaulting discovered direct URLs to `wss://`, rejecting insecure non-loopback `ws://` targets in onboarding validation, and expanding remote-security remediation messaging across gateway client/call/doctor flows. (#23476) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- CLI/Sessions: pass the configured sessions directory when resolving transcript paths in `agentCommand`, so custom `session.store` locations resume sessions reliably. Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Signal/Monitor: treat user-initiated abort shutdowns as clean exits when auto-started `signal-cli` is terminated, while still surfacing unexpected daemon exits as startup/runtime failures. (#23379) Thanks @frankekn.
- Channels/Dedupe: centralize plugin dedupe primitives in plugin SDK (memory + persistent), move Feishu inbound dedupe to a namespace-scoped persistent store, and reuse shared dedupe cache logic for Zalo webhook replay + Tlon processed-message tracking to reduce duplicate handling during reconnect/replay paths. (#23377) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Channels/Delivery: remove hardcoded WhatsApp delivery fallbacks; require explicit/session channel context or auto-pick the sole configured channel when unambiguous. (#23357) Thanks @lbo728.
- ACP/Gateway: wait for gateway hello before opening ACP requests, and fail fast on pre-hello connect failures to avoid startup hangs and early `gateway not connected` request races. (#23390) Thanks @janckerchen.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` env override precedence for remote gateway call credentials after shared resolver refactors, preventing stale configured remote passwords from overriding runtime secret rotation.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve shared-token `gateway token mismatch` auth errors when `auth.token` fallback device-token checks fail, and reserve `device token mismatch` guidance for explicit `auth.deviceToken` failures.
- Gateway/Tools: when agent tools pass an allowlisted `gatewayUrl` override, resolve local override tokens from env/config fallback but keep remote overrides strict to `gateway.remote.token`, preventing local token leakage to remote targets.
- Gateway/Client: keep cached device-auth tokens on `device token mismatch` closes when the client used explicit shared token/password credentials, avoiding accidental pairing-token churn during explicit-auth failures.
- Node host/Exec: keep strict Windows allowlist behavior for `cmd.exe /c` shell-wrapper runs, and return explicit approval guidance when blocked (`SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss`).
- Control UI: show pairing-required guidance (commands + mobile tokenized URL reminder) when the dashboard disconnects with `1008 pairing required`.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` detection for open group policies that expose runtime/filesystem tools without sandbox/workspace guards (`security.exposure.open_groups_with_runtime_or_fs`).
- Security/Audit: make `gateway.real_ip_fallback_enabled` severity conditional for loopback trusted-proxy setups (warn for loopback-only `trustedProxies`, critical when non-loopback proxies are trusted). (#23428) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Exec env: block request-scoped `HOME` and `ZDOTDIR` overrides in host exec env sanitizers (Node + macOS), preventing shell startup-file execution before allowlist-evaluated command bodies. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec env: block `SHELLOPTS`/`PS4` in host exec env sanitizers and restrict shell-wrapper (`bash|sh|zsh ... -c/-lc`) request env overrides to a small explicit allowlist (`TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`) on both node host and macOS companion paths, preventing xtrace prompt command-substitution allowlist bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce `allowFrom` for direct-message outbound targets in all send modes (including `mode: "explicit"`), preventing sends to non-allowlisted numbers. (#20108) Thanks @zahlmann.
- Security/Exec approvals: fail closed on shell line continuations (`\\\n`/`\\\r\n`) and treat shell-wrapper execution as approval-required in allowlist mode, preventing `$\\` newline command-substitution bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: emit a startup security warning when insecure/dangerous config flags are enabled (including `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth=true`) and point operators to `openclaw security audit`.
- Security/Hooks auth: normalize hook auth rate-limit client IP keys so IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses share one throttle bucket, preventing dual-form auth-attempt budget bypasses. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: treat `env` and shell-dispatch wrappers as transparent during allowlist analysis on node-host and macOS companion paths so policy checks match the effective executable/inline shell payload instead of the wrapper binary, blocking wrapper-smuggled allowlist bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: require explicit safe-bin profiles for `tools.exec.safeBins` entries in allowlist mode (remove generic safe-bin profile fallback), and add `tools.exec.safeBinProfiles` for safe custom binaries so unprofiled interpreter-style entries cannot be treated as stdin-safe. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Channels: harden Slack external menu token handling by switching to CSPRNG tokens, validating token shape, requiring user identity for external option lookups, and avoiding fabricated timestamp `trigger_id` fallbacks; also switch Tlon Urbit channel IDs to CSPRNG UUIDs, centralize secure ID/token generation via shared infra helpers, and add a guardrail test to block new runtime `Date.now()+Math.random()` token/id patterns.
- Security/Hooks transforms: enforce symlink-safe containment for webhook transform module paths (including `hooks.transformsDir` and `hooks.mappings[].transform.module`) by resolving existing-path ancestors via realpath before import, while preserving in-root symlink support; add regression coverage for both escape and allow cases. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Telegram/WSL2: disable `autoSelectFamily` by default on WSL2 and memoize WSL2 detection in Telegram network decision logic to avoid repeated sync `/proc/version` probes on fetch/send paths. (#21916) Thanks @MizukiMachine.
- Telegram/Network: default Node 22+ DNS result ordering to `ipv4first` for Telegram fetch paths and add `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_DNS_RESULT_ORDER`/`channels.telegram.network.dnsResultOrder` overrides to reduce IPv6-path fetch failures. (#5405) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Forward bursts: coalesce forwarded text+media updates through a dedicated forward lane debounce window that works with default inbound debounce config, while keeping forwarded control commands immediate. (#19476) thanks @napetrov.
- Telegram/Streaming: preserve archived draft preview mapping after flush and clean superseded reasoning preview bubbles so multi-message preview finals no longer cross-edit or orphan stale messages under send/rotation races. (#23202) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Replies: scope messaging-tool text/media dedupe to same-target sends only, so cross-target tool sends can no longer silently suppress Telegram final replies.
- Telegram/Replies: normalize `file://` and local-path media variants during messaging dedupe so equivalent media paths do not produce duplicate Telegram replies.
- Telegram/Replies: extract forwarded-origin context from unified reply targets (`reply_to_message` and `external_reply`) so forward+comment metadata is preserved across partial reply shapes. (#9720) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Polling: persist a safe update-offset watermark bounded by pending updates so crash/restart cannot skip queued lower `update_id` updates after out-of-order completion. (#23284) thanks @frankekn.
- Telegram/Polling: force-restart stuck runner instances when recoverable unhandled network rejections escape the polling task path, so polling resumes instead of silently stalling. (#19721) Thanks @jg-noncelogic.
- Slack/Slash commands: preserve the Bolt app receiver when registering external select options handlers so monitor startup does not crash on runtimes that require bound `app.options` calls. (#23209) Thanks @0xgaia.
- Slack/Telegram slash sessions: await session metadata persistence before dispatch so first-turn native slash runs do not race session-origin metadata updates. (#23065) thanks @hydro13.
- Slack/Queue routing: preserve string `thread_ts` values through collect-mode queue drain and DM `deliveryContext` updates so threaded follow-ups do not leak to the main channel when Slack thread IDs are strings. (#11934) Thanks @sandieman2 and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Native commands: set `ctx.Provider="telegram"` for native slash-command context so elevated gate checks resolve provider correctly (fixes `provider (ctx.Provider)` failures in `/elevated` flows). (#23748) Thanks @serhii12.
- Agents/Ollama: preserve unsafe integer tool-call arguments as exact strings during NDJSON parsing, preventing large numeric IDs from being rounded before tool execution. (#23170) Thanks @BestJoester.
- Cron/Gateway: keep `cron.list` and `cron.status` responsive during startup catch-up by avoiding a long-held cron lock while missed jobs execute. (#23106) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Gateway/Config reload: compare array-valued config paths structurally during diffing so unchanged `memory.qmd.paths` and `memory.qmd.scope.rules` no longer trigger false restart-required reloads. (#23185) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Gateway/Config reload: retry short-lived missing config snapshots during reload before skipping, preventing atomic-write unlink windows from triggering restart loops. (#23343) Thanks @lbo728.
- Cron/Scheduling: validate runtime cron expressions before schedule/stagger evaluation so malformed persisted jobs report a clear `invalid cron schedule: expr is required` error instead of crashing with `undefined.trim` failures and auto-disable churn. (#23223) Thanks @asimons81.
- Memory/QMD: migrate legacy unscoped collection bindings (for example `memory-root`) to per-agent scoped names (for example `memory-root-main`) during startup when safe, so QMD-backed `memory_search` no longer fails with `Collection not found` after upgrades. (#23228, #20727) Thanks @JLDynamics and @AaronFaby.
- Memory/QMD: normalize Han-script BM25 search queries before invoking `qmd search` so mixed CJK+Latin prompts no longer return empty results due to tokenizer mismatch. (#23426) Thanks @LunaLee0130.
- TUI/Input: enable multiline-paste burst coalescing on macOS Terminal.app and iTerm so pasted blocks no longer submit line-by-line as separate messages. (#18809) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/RTL: isolate right-to-left script lines (Arabic/Hebrew ranges) with Unicode bidi isolation marks in TUI text sanitization so RTL assistant output no longer renders in reversed visual order in terminal chat panes. (#21936) Thanks @Asm3r96.
- TUI/Status: request immediate renders after setting `sending`/`waiting` activity states so in-flight runs always show visible progress indicators instead of appearing idle until completion. (#21549) Thanks @13Guinness.
- TUI/Input: arm Ctrl+C exit timing when clearing non-empty composer text and add a SIGINT fallback path so double Ctrl+C exits remain responsive during active runs instead of requiring an extra press or appearing stuck. (#23407) Thanks @tinybluedev.
- Agents/Fallbacks: treat JSON payloads with `type: "api_error"` + `"Internal server error"` as transient failover errors so Anthropic 500-style failures trigger model fallback. (#23193) Thanks @jarvis-lane.
- Agents/Google: sanitize non-base64 `thought_signature`/`thoughtSignature` values from assistant replay transcripts for native Google Gemini requests while preserving valid signatures and tool-call order. (#23457) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Transcripts: validate assistant tool-call names (syntax/length + registered tool allowlist) before transcript persistence and during replay sanitization so malformed failover tool names no longer poison sessions with repeated provider HTTP 400 errors. (#23324) Thanks @johnsantry.
- Agents/Mistral: sanitize tool-call IDs in the embedded agent loop and generate strict provider-safe pending tool-call IDs, preventing Mistral strict9 `HTTP 400` failures on tool continuations. (#23698) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Compaction: strip stale assistant usage snapshots from pre-compaction turns when replaying history after a compaction summary so context-token estimation no longer reuses pre-compaction totals and immediately re-triggers destructive follow-up compactions. (#19127) Thanks @tedwatson.
- Agents/Replies: emit a default completion acknowledgement (`✅ Done.`) only for direct/private tool-only completions with no final assistant text, while suppressing synthetic acknowledgements for channel/group sessions and runs that already delivered output via messaging tools. (#22834) Thanks @Oldshue.
- Agents/Subagents: honor `tools.subagents.tools.alsoAllow` and explicit subagent `allow` entries when resolving built-in subagent deny defaults, so explicitly granted tools (for example `sessions_send`) are no longer blocked unless re-denied in `tools.subagents.tools.deny`. (#23359) Thanks @goren-beehero.
- Agents/Subagents: make announce call timeouts configurable via `agents.defaults.subagents.announceTimeoutMs` and restore a 60s default to prevent false timeout failures on slower announce paths. (#22719) Thanks @Valadon.
- Agents/Diagnostics: include resolved lifecycle error text in `embedded run agent end` warnings so UI/TUI “Connection error” runs expose actionable provider failure reasons in gateway logs. (#23054) Thanks @Raize.
- Agents/Auth profiles: resolve `agentCommand` session scope before choosing `agentDir`/workspace so resumed runs no longer read auth from `agents/main/agent` when the resolved session belongs to a different/default agent (for example `agent:exec:*` sessions). (#24016) Thanks @abersonFAC.
- Agents/Auth profiles: skip auth-profile cooldown writes for timeout failures in embedded runner rotation so model/network timeouts do not poison same-provider fallback model selection while still allowing in-turn account rotation. (#22622) Thanks @vageeshkumar.
- Plugins/Hooks: run legacy `before_agent_start` once per agent turn and reuse that result across model-resolve and prompt-build compatibility paths, preventing duplicate hook side effects (for example duplicate external API calls). (#23289) Thanks @ksato8710.
- Models/Config: default missing Anthropic provider/model `api` fields to `anthropic-messages` during config validation so custom relay model entries are preserved instead of being dropped by runtime model registry validation. (#23332) Thanks @bigbigmonkey123.
- Gateway/Pairing: preserve existing approved token scopes when processing repair pairings that omit `scopes`, preventing empty-scope token regressions on reconnecting clients. (#21906) Thanks @paki81.
- Memory/QMD: add optional `memory.qmd.mcporter` search routing so QMD `query/search/vsearch` can run through mcporter keep-alive flows (including multi-collection paths) to reduce cold starts, while keeping searches on agent-scoped QMD state for consistent recall. (#19617) Thanks @nicole-luxe and @vignesh07.
- Infra/Network: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as transient in unhandled-rejection detection even when nested causes are unclassified, preventing avoidable gateway crash loops on flaky networks. (#14345) Thanks @Unayung.
- Telegram/Retry: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as recoverable in both polling and send retry paths so transient fetch failures no longer fail fast. (#16699) thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docs/Telegram: correct Node 22+ network defaults (`autoSelectFamily`, `dnsResultOrder`) and clarify Telegram setup does not use positional `openclaw channels login telegram`. (#23609) Thanks @ryanbastic.
- BlueBubbles/DM history: restore DM backfill context with account-scoped rolling history, bounded backfill retries, and safer history payload limits. (#20302) Thanks @Ryan-Haines.
- BlueBubbles/Private API cache: treat unknown (`null`) private-API cache status as disabled for send/attachment/reply flows to avoid stale-cache 500s, and log a warning when reply/effect features are requested while capability is unknown. (#23459) Thanks @echoVic.
- BlueBubbles/Webhooks: accept inbound/reaction webhook payloads when BlueBubbles omits `handle` but provides DM `chatGuid`, and harden payload extraction for array/string-wrapped message bodies so valid webhook events no longer get rejected as unparseable. (#23275) Thanks @toph31.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` finding `gateway.nodes.allow_commands_dangerous` for risky `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` overrides, with severity upgraded to critical on remote gateway exposure.
- Gateway/Control plane: reduce cross-client write limiter contention by adding `connId` fallback keying when device ID and client IP are both unavailable.
- Security/Config: block prototype-key traversal during config merge patch and legacy migration merge helpers (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) to prevent prototype pollution during config mutation flows. (#22968) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Security/Shell env: validate login-shell executable paths for shell-env fallback (`/etc/shells` + trusted prefixes), block `SHELL`/`HOME`/`ZDOTDIR` in config env ingestion before fallback execution, and sanitize fallback shell exec env to pin `HOME` to the real user home while dropping `ZDOTDIR` and other dangerous startup vars. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Network/SSRF: enable `autoSelectFamily` on pinned undici dispatchers (with attempt timeout) so IPv6-unreachable environments can quickly fall back to IPv4 for guarded fetch paths. (#19950) Thanks @ENAwareness.
- Security/Config: make parsed chat allowlist checks fail closed when `allowFrom` is empty, restoring expected DM/pairing gating.
- Security/Exec: in non-default setups that manually add `sort` to `tools.exec.safeBins`, block `sort --compress-program` so allowlist-mode safe-bin checks cannot bypass approval. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: when users choose `allow-always` for shell-wrapper commands (for example `/bin/zsh -lc ...`), persist allowlist patterns for the inner executable(s) instead of the wrapper shell binary, preventing accidental broad shell allowlisting in moderate mode. (#23276) Thanks @xrom2863.
- Security/Exec: fail closed when `tools.exec.host=sandbox` is configured/requested but sandbox runtime is unavailable. (#23398) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/macOS app beta: enforce path-only `system.run` allowlist matching (drop basename matches like `echo`), migrate legacy basename entries to last resolved paths when available, and harden shell-chain handling to fail closed on unsafe parse/control syntax (including quoted command substitution/backticks). This is an optional allowlist-mode feature; default installs remain deny-by-default. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Agents: auto-generate and persist a dedicated `commands.ownerDisplaySecret` when `commands.ownerDisplay=hash`, remove gateway token fallback from owner-ID prompt hashing across CLI and embedded agent runners, and centralize owner-display secret resolution in one shared helper. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: expand IPv4 fetch guard blocking to include RFC special-use/non-global ranges (including benchmarking, TEST-NET, multicast, and reserved/broadcast blocks), centralize range checks into a single CIDR policy table, and reuse one shared host/IP classifier across literal + DNS checks to reduce classifier drift. Thanks @princeeismond-dot for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: block RFC2544 benchmarking range (`198.18.0.0/15`) across direct and embedded-IP paths, and normalize IPv6 dotted-quad transition literals (for example `::127.0.0.1`, `64:ff9b::8.8.8.8`) in shared IP parsing/classification.
- Security/Archive: block zip symlink escapes during archive extraction.
- Security/Media sandbox: keep tmp media allowance for absolute tmp paths only and enforce symlink-escape checks before sandbox-validated reads, preventing tmp symlink exfiltration and relative `../` sandbox escapes when sandboxes live under tmp. (#17892) Thanks @dashed.
- Browser/Upload: accept canonical in-root upload paths when the configured uploads directory is a symlink alias (for example `/tmp` -> `/private/tmp` on macOS), so browser upload validation no longer rejects valid files during client->server revalidation. (#23300, #23222, #22848) Thanks @bgaither4, @parkerati, and @Nabsku.
- Security/Discord: add `openclaw security audit` warnings for name/tag-based Discord allowlist entries (DM allowlists, guild/channel `users`, and pairing-store entries), highlighting slug-collision risk while keeping name-based matching supported, and canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs at runtime without rewriting config files. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: block node-role connections when device identity metadata is missing.
- Security/Media: enforce inbound media byte limits during download/read across Discord, Telegram, Zalo, Microsoft Teams, and BlueBubbles to prevent oversized payload memory spikes before rejection. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Media/Understanding: preserve `application/pdf` MIME classification during text-like file heuristics so PDF uploads use PDF extraction paths instead of being inlined as raw text. (#23191) Thanks @claudeplay2026-byte.
- Security/Control UI: block symlink-based out-of-root static file reads by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks when serving Control UI assets and SPA fallback `index.html`. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway avatars: block symlink traversal during local avatar `data:` URL resolution by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks before reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Control UI: centralize avatar URL/path validation across gateway/config helpers and enforce a 2 MB max size for local agent avatar files before `/avatar` resolution, reducing oversized-avatar memory risk without changing supported avatar formats.
- Security/Control UI avatars: harden `/avatar/:agentId` local avatar serving by rejecting symlink paths and requiring fd-level file identity + size checks before reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: enforce allowlist checks for SharePoint reference attachment URLs and redirect targets during Graph-backed media fetches so redirect chains cannot escape configured media host boundaries. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: route attachment auth-retry and Graph SharePoint download redirects through shared `safeFetch` so each hop is validated with allowlist + DNS/IP checks across the full redirect chain. (#23598) Thanks @Asm3r96 and @lewiswigmore.
- Security/MSTeams auth redirect scoping: strip bearer auth on redirect hops outside `authAllowHosts` and gate SharePoint Graph auth-header injection by auth allowlist to prevent token bleed across redirect targets. (#25045) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- MSTeams/reply reliability: when Bot Framework revokes thread turn-context proxies (for example debounced flush paths), fall back to proactive messaging/typing and continue pending sends without duplicating already delivered messages. (#27224) Thanks @openperf.
- Security/macOS discovery: fail closed for unresolved discovery endpoints by clearing stale remote selection values, use resolved service host only for SSH target derivation, and keep remote URL config aligned with resolved endpoint availability. (#21618) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Chat/Usage/TUI: strip synthetic inbound metadata blocks (including `Conversation info` and trailing `Untrusted context` channel metadata wrappers) from displayed conversation history so internal prompt context no longer leaks into user-visible logs.
- CI/Tests: fix TypeScript case-table typing and lint assertion regressions so `pnpm check` passes again after Synology Chat landing. (#23012) Thanks @druide67.
- Security/Browser relay: harden extension relay auth token handling for `/extension` and `/cdp` pathways.
- Cron: persist `delivered` state in cron job records so delivery failures remain visible in status and logs. (#19174) Thanks @simonemacario.
- Config/Doctor: only repair the OAuth credentials directory when affected channels are configured, avoiding fresh-install noise.
- Config/Channels: whitelist `channels.modelByChannel` in config validation and exclude it from plugin auto-enable channel detection so model overrides no longer trigger `unknown channel id` validation errors or bogus `modelByChannel` plugin enables. (#23412) Thanks @ProspectOre.
- Config/Bindings: allow optional `bindings[].comment` in strict config validation so annotated binding entries no longer fail load. (#23458) Thanks @echoVic.
- Usage/Pricing: correct MiniMax M2.5 pricing defaults to fix inflated cost reporting. (#22755) Thanks @miloudbelarebia.
- Gateway/Daemon: verify gateway health after daemon restart.
- Agents/UI text: stop rewriting normal assistant billing/payment language outside explicit error contexts. (#17834) Thanks @niceysam.

- Security/Agents: make owner-ID obfuscation use a dedicated HMAC secret from configuration (`ownerDisplaySecret`) and update hashing behavior so obfuscation is decoupled from gateway token handling for improved control. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Infra: switch gateway lock and tool-call synthetic IDs from SHA-1 to SHA-256 with unchanged truncation length to strengthen hash basis while keeping deterministic behavior and lock key format. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/Tooling: add non-blocking dead-code scans in CI via Knip/ts-prune/ts-unused-exports to surface unused dependencies and exports earlier. (#22468) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/Unused Dependencies: remove or scope unused root and extension deps (`@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk`, `signal-utils`, `ollama`, `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-express`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-extensions-teams`, and plugin-local `openclaw` devDeps in `extensions/open-prose`, `extensions/lobster`, and `extensions/llm-task`). (#22471, #22495) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/A2UI: harden dependency resolution after root cleanup (resolve `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, and `signal-utils` from workspace/root) and simplify bundling fallback behavior, including `pnpm dlx rolldown` compatibility. (#22481, #22507) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Agents/Bootstrap: skip malformed bootstrap files with missing/invalid paths instead of crashing agent sessions; hooks using `filePath` (or non-string `path`) are skipped with a warning. (#22693, #22698) Thanks @arosstale.
- Security/Agents: cap embedded Pi runner outer retry loop with a higher profile-aware dynamic limit (32-160 attempts) and return an explicit `retry_limit` error payload when retries never converge, preventing unbounded internal retry cycles (`GHSA-76m6-pj3w-v7mf`).
- Telegram: detect duplicate bot-token ownership across Telegram accounts at startup/status time, mark secondary accounts as not configured with an explicit fix message, and block duplicate account startup before polling to avoid endless `getUpdates` conflict loops.
- Agents/Tool images: include source filenames in `agents/tool-images` resize logs so compression events can be traced back to specific files.
- Providers/OAuth: harden Qwen and Chutes refresh handling by validating refresh response expiry values and preserving prior refresh tokens when providers return empty refresh token fields, with regression coverage for empty-token responses.
- Models/Kimi-Coding: add missing implicit provider template for `kimi-coding` with correct `anthropic-messages` API type and base URL, fixing 403 errors when using Kimi for Coding. (#22409)
- Auto-reply/Tools: forward `senderIsOwner` through embedded queued/followup runner params so owner-only tools remain available for authorized senders. (#22296) thanks @hcoj.
- Discord: restore model picker back navigation when a provider is missing and document the Discord picker flow. (#21458) Thanks @pejmanjohn and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory/QMD: respect per-agent `memorySearch.enabled=false` during gateway QMD startup initialization, split multi-collection QMD searches into per-collection queries (`search`/`vsearch`/`query`) to avoid sparse-term drops, prefer collection-hinted doc resolution to avoid stale-hash collisions, retry boot updates on transient lock/timeout failures, skip `qmd embed` in BM25-only `search` mode (including `memory index --force`), and serialize embed runs globally with failure backoff to prevent CPU storms on multi-agent hosts. (#20581, #21590, #20513, #20001, #21266, #21583, #20346, #19493) Thanks @danielrevivo, @zanderkrause, @sunyan034-cmd, @tilleulenspiegel, @dae-oss, @adamlongcreativellc, @jonathanadams96, and @kiliansitel.
- Memory/Builtin: prevent automatic sync races with manager shutdown by skipping post-close sync starts and waiting for in-flight sync before closing SQLite, so `onSearch`/`onSessionStart` no longer fail with `database is not open` in ephemeral CLI flows. (#20556, #7464) Thanks @FuzzyTG and @henrybottter.
- Providers/Copilot: drop persisted assistant `thinking` blocks for Claude models (while preserving turn structure/tool blocks) so follow-up requests no longer fail on invalid `thinkingSignature` payloads. (#19459) Thanks @jackheuberger.
- Providers/Copilot: add `claude-sonnet-4.6` and `claude-sonnet-4.5` to the default GitHub Copilot model catalog and add coverage for model-list/definition helpers. (#20270, fixes #20091) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Auto-reply/WebChat: avoid defaulting inbound runtime channel labels to unrelated providers (for example `whatsapp`) for webchat sessions so channel-specific formatting guidance stays accurate. (#21534) Thanks @lbo728.
- Status: include persisted `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` in session summaries so compact `/status` output consistently shows cache hit percentages from real session data.
- Sessions/Usage: persist `totalTokens` from `promptTokens` snapshots even when providers omit structured usage payloads, so session history/status no longer regress to `unknown` token utilization for otherwise successful runs. (#21819) Thanks @zymclaw.
- Heartbeat/Cron: restore interval heartbeat behavior so missing `HEARTBEAT.md` no longer suppresses runs (only effectively empty files skip), preserving prompt-driven and tagged-cron execution paths.
- WhatsApp/Cron/Heartbeat: enforce allowlisted routing for implicit scheduled/system delivery by merging pairing-store + configured `allowFrom` recipients, selecting authorized recipients when last-route context points to a non-allowlisted chat, and preventing heartbeat fan-out to recent unauthorized chats.
- Heartbeat/Active hours: constrain active-hours `24` sentinel parsing to `24:00` in time validation so invalid values like `24:30` are rejected early. (#21410) thanks @adhitShet.
- Heartbeat: treat `activeHours` windows with identical `start`/`end` times as zero-width (always outside the window) instead of always-active. (#21408) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Pairing: default `pairing list` and `pairing approve` to the sole available pairing channel when omitted, so TUI-only setups can recover from `pairing required` without guessing channel arguments. (#21527) Thanks @losts1.
- TUI/Pairing: show explicit pairing-required recovery guidance after gateway disconnects that return `pairing required`, including approval steps to unblock quickstart TUI hatching on fresh installs. (#21841) Thanks @nicolinux.

- TUI/Models: scope `models.list` to the configured model allowlist (`agents.defaults.models`) so `/model` picker no longer floods with unrelated catalog entries by default. (#18816) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/Heartbeat: suppress heartbeat ACK/prompt noise in chat streaming when `showOk` is disabled, while still preserving non-ACK heartbeat alerts in final output. (#20228) Thanks @bhalliburton.
- TUI/History: cap chat-log component growth and prune stale render nodes/references so large default history loads no longer overflow render recursion with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. (#18068) Thanks @JaniJegoroff.
- Memory/QMD: diversify mixed-source search ranking when both session and memory collections are present so session transcript hits no longer crowd out durable memory-file matches in top results. (#19913) Thanks @alextempr.
- Memory/Tools: return explicit `unavailable` warnings/actions from `memory_search` when embedding/provider failures occur (including quota exhaustion), so disabled memory does not look like an empty recall result. (#21894) Thanks @XBS9.
- Session/Startup: require the `/new` and `/reset` greeting path to run Session Startup file-reading instructions before responding, so daily memory startup context is not skipped on fresh-session greetings. (#22338) Thanks @armstrong-pv.
- Auth/Onboarding: align OAuth profile-id config mapping with stored credential IDs for OpenAI Codex and Chutes flows, preventing `provider:default` mismatches when OAuth returns email-scoped credentials. (#12692) thanks @mudrii.
- Provider/HTTP: treat HTTP 503 as failover-eligible for LLM provider errors. (#21086) Thanks @Protocol-zero-0.
- Slack: pass `recipient_team_id` / `recipient_user_id` through Slack native streaming calls so `chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream` work reliably across DMs and Slack Connect setups, and disable block streaming when native streaming is active. (#20988) Thanks @Dithilli. Earlier recipient-ID groundwork was contributed in #20377 by @AsserAl1012.
- CLI/Config: add canonical `--strict-json` parsing for `config set` and keep `--json` as a legacy alias to reduce help/behavior drift. (#21332) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Config: preserve explicitly unset config paths in persisted JSON after writes so `openclaw config unset <path>` no longer re-introduces defaulted keys (for example `commands.ownerDisplay`) through schema normalization. (#22984) Thanks @aronchick.
- CLI: keep `openclaw -v` as a root-only version alias so subcommand `-v, --verbose` flags (for example ACP/hooks/skills) are no longer intercepted globally. (#21303) thanks @adhitShet.
- Memory: return empty snippets when `memory_get`/QMD read files that have not been created yet, and harden memory indexing/session helpers against ENOENT races so missing Markdown no longer crashes tools. (#20680) Thanks @pahdo.
- Telegram/Streaming: always clean up draft previews even when dispatch throws before fallback handling, preventing orphaned preview messages during failed runs. (#19041) thanks @mudrii.
- Telegram/Streaming: split reasoning and answer draft preview lanes to prevent cross-lane overwrites, and ignore literal `<think>` tags inside inline/fenced code snippets so sample markup is not misrouted as reasoning. (#20774) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Streaming: restore 30-char first-preview debounce and scope `NO_REPLY` prefix suppression to partial sentinel fragments so normal `No...` text is not filtered. (#22613) thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Status reactions: refresh stall timers on repeated phase updates and honor ack-reaction scope when lifecycle reactions are enabled, preventing false stall emojis and unwanted group reactions. Thanks @wolly-tundracube and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Telegram/Status reactions: keep lifecycle reactions active when available-reactions lookup fails by falling back to unrestricted variant selection instead of suppressing reaction updates. (#22380) thanks @obviyus.
- Discord/Events: await `DiscordMessageListener` message handlers so regular `MESSAGE_CREATE` traffic is processed through queue ordering/timeout flow instead of fire-and-forget drops. (#22396) Thanks @sIlENtbuffER.
- Discord/Streaming: apply `replyToMode: first` only to the first Discord chunk so block-streamed replies do not spam mention pings. (#20726) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow for the report.
- Discord/Components: map DM channel targets back to user-scoped component sessions so button/select interactions stay in the main DM session. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/Allowlist: lazy-load guild lists when resolving Discord user allowlists so ID-only entries resolve even if guild fetch fails. (#20208) Thanks @zhangjunmengyang.
- Discord/Gateway: handle close code 4014 (missing privileged gateway intents) without crashing the gateway. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: ingest inbound stickers as media so sticker-only messages and forwarded stickers are visible to agents. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Runner: emit `onAgentRunStart` only after agent lifecycle or tool activity begins (and only once per run), so fallback preflight errors no longer mark runs as started. (#21165) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Auto-reply/Tool results: serialize tool-result delivery and keep the delivery chain progressing after individual failures so concurrent tool outputs preserve user-visible ordering. (#21231) thanks @ahdernasr.
- Auto-reply/Prompt caching: restore prefix-cache stability by keeping inbound system metadata session-stable and moving per-message IDs (`message_id`, `message_id_full`, `reply_to_id`, `sender_id`) into untrusted conversation context. (#20597) Thanks @anisoptera.
- iOS/Watch: add actionable watch approval/reject controls and quick-reply actions so watch-originated approvals and responses can be sent directly from notification flows. (#21996) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Watch: refresh iOS and watch app icon assets with the lobster icon set to keep phone/watch branding aligned. (#21997) Thanks @mbelinky.
- CLI/Onboarding: fix Anthropic-compatible custom provider verification by normalizing base URLs to avoid duplicate `/v1` paths during setup checks. (#21336) Thanks @17jmumford.
- iOS/Gateway/Tools: prefer uniquely connected node matches when duplicate display names exist, surface actionable `nodes invoke` pairing-required guidance with request IDs, and refresh active iOS gateway registration after location-capability setting changes so capability updates apply immediately. (#22120) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: require `gateway.trustedProxies` to include a loopback proxy address when `auth.mode="trusted-proxy"` and `bind="loopback"`, preventing same-host proxy misconfiguration from silently blocking auth. (#22082, follow-up to #20097) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy mode with loopback bind for same-host reverse-proxy deployments, while still requiring configured `gateway.trustedProxies`. (#20097) thanks @xinhuagu.
- Gateway/Auth: allow authenticated clients across roles/scopes to call `health` while preserving role and scope enforcement for non-health methods. (#19699) thanks @Nachx639.
- Gateway/Hooks: include transform export name in hook-transform cache keys so distinct exports from the same module do not reuse the wrong cached transform function. (#13855) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Control UI: return 404 for missing static-asset paths instead of serving SPA fallback HTML, while preserving client-route fallback behavior for extensionless and non-asset dotted paths. (#12060) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Pairing: prevent device-token rotate scope escalation by enforcing an approved-scope baseline, preserving approved scopes across metadata updates, and rejecting rotate requests that exceed approved role scope implications. (#20703) thanks @coygeek.
- Gateway/Pairing: clear persisted paired-device state when the gateway client closes with `device token mismatch` (`1008`) so reconnect flows can cleanly re-enter pairing. (#22071) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Config: allow `gateway.customBindHost` in strict config validation when `gateway.bind="custom"` so valid custom bind-host configurations no longer fail startup. (#20318, fixes #20289) Thanks @MisterGuy420.
- Gateway/Pairing: tolerate legacy paired devices missing `roles`/`scopes` metadata in websocket upgrade checks and backfill metadata on reconnect. (#21447, fixes #21236) Thanks @joshavant.
- Gateway/Pairing/CLI: align read-scope compatibility in pairing/device-token checks and add local `openclaw devices` fallback recovery for loopback `pairing required` deadlocks, with explicit fallback notice to unblock approval bootstrap flows. (#21616) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Agents/Subagents: restore announce-chain delivery to agent injection, defer nested announce output until descendant follow-up content is ready, and prevent descendant deferrals from consuming announce retry budget so deep chains do not drop final completions. (#22223) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/System Prompt: label allowlisted senders as authorized senders to avoid implying ownership. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Agents/Tool display: fix exec cwd suffix inference so `pushd ... && popd ... && <command>` does not keep stale `(in <dir>)` context in summaries. (#21925) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Agents/Google: flatten residual nested `anyOf`/`oneOf` unions in Gemini tool-schema cleanup so Cloud Code Assist no longer rejects unsupported union keywords that survive earlier simplification. (#22825) Thanks @Oceanswave.
- Tools/web_search: handle xAI Responses API payloads that emit top-level `output_text` blocks (without a `message` wrapper) so Grok web_search no longer returns `No response` for those results. (#20508) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Failover: treat non-default override runs as direct fallback-to-configured-primary (skip configured fallback chain), normalize default-model detection for provider casing/whitespace, and add regression coverage for override/auth error paths. (#18820) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docker/Build: include `ownerDisplay` in `CommandsSchema` object-level defaults so Docker `pnpm build` no longer fails with `TS2769` during plugin SDK d.ts generation. (#22558) Thanks @obviyus.
- Docker/Browser: install Playwright Chromium into `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright` and set `node:node` ownership so browser binaries are available to the runtime user in browser-enabled images. (#22585) thanks @obviyus.
- Hooks/Session memory: trigger bundled `session-memory` persistence on both `/new` and `/reset` so reset flows no longer skip markdown transcript capture before archival. (#21382) Thanks @mofesolapaul.
- Dependencies/Agents: bump embedded Pi SDK packages (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`) to `0.54.0`. (#21578) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Config/Agents: expose Pi compaction tuning values `agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokens` and `agents.defaults.compaction.keepRecentTokens` in config schema/types and apply them in embedded Pi runner settings overrides with floor enforcement via `reserveTokensFloor`. (#21568) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Docker: pin base images to SHA256 digests in Docker builds to prevent mutable tag drift. (#7734) Thanks @coygeek.
- Docker: run build steps as the `node` user and use `COPY --chown` to avoid recursive ownership changes, trimming image size and layer churn. Thanks @huntharo.
- Config/Memory: restore schema help/label metadata for hybrid `mmr` and `temporalDecay` settings so configuration surfaces show correct names and guidance. (#18786) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Skills/SonosCLI: add troubleshooting guidance for `sonos discover` failures on macOS direct mode (`sendto: no route to host`) and sandbox network restrictions (`bind: operation not permitted`). (#21316) Thanks @huntharo.
- macOS/Build: default release packaging to `BUNDLE_ID=ai.openclaw.mac` in `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh`, so Sparkle feed URL is retained and auto-update no longer fails with an empty appcast feed. (#19750) thanks @loganprit.
- Signal/Outbound: preserve case for Base64 group IDs during outbound target normalization so cross-context routing and policy checks no longer break when group IDs include uppercase characters. (#5578) Thanks @heyhudson.
- Anthropic/Agents: preserve required pi-ai default OAuth beta headers when `context1m` injects `anthropic-beta`, preventing 401 auth failures for `sk-ant-oat-*` tokens. (#19789, fixes #19769) Thanks @minupla.
- Security/Exec: block unquoted heredoc body expansion tokens in shell allowlist analysis, reject unterminated heredocs, and require explicit approval for allowlisted heredoc execution on gateway hosts to prevent heredoc substitution allowlist bypass. Thanks @torturado for reporting.
- macOS/Security: evaluate `system.run` allowlists per shell segment in macOS node runtime and companion exec host (including chained shell operators), fail closed on shell/process substitution parsing, and require explicit approval on unsafe parse cases to prevent allowlist bypass via `rawCommand` chaining. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce allowlist JID authorization for reaction actions so authenticated callers cannot target non-allowlisted chats by forging `chatJid` + valid `messageId` pairs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- ACP/Security: escape control and delimiter characters in ACP `resource_link` title/URI metadata before prompt interpolation to prevent metadata-driven prompt injection through resource links. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- TTS/Security: make model-driven provider switching opt-in by default (`messages.tts.modelOverrides.allowProvider=false` unless explicitly enabled), while keeping voice/style overrides available, to reduce prompt-injection-driven provider hops and unexpected TTS cost escalation. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Agents: keep overflow compaction retry budgeting global across tool-result truncation recovery so successful truncation cannot reset the overflow retry counter and amplify retry/cost cycles. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- BlueBubbles/Security: require webhook token authentication for all BlueBubbles webhook requests (including loopback/proxied setups), removing passwordless webhook fallback behavior. Thanks @zpbrent.
- iOS/Security: force `https://` for non-loopback manual gateway hosts during iOS onboarding to block insecure remote transport URLs. (#21969) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Security: remove shared-IP fallback for canvas endpoints and require token or session capability for canvas access. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.

- Gateway/Security: scope tokenless Tailscale forwarded-header auth to Control UI websocket auth only, so HTTP gateway routes still require token/password even on trusted hosts. Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Docker/Security: run E2E and install-sh test images as non-root by adding appuser directives. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Skills/Security: sanitize skill env overrides to block unsafe runtime injection variables and only allow sensitive keys when declared in skill metadata, with warnings for suspicious values. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Commands: block prototype-key injection in runtime `/debug` overrides and require own-property checks for gated command flags (`bash`, `config`, `debug`) so inherited prototype values cannot enable privileged commands. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser: block non-network browser navigation protocols (including `file:`, `data:`, and `javascript:`) while preserving `about:blank`, preventing local file reads via browser tool navigation. Thanks @q1uf3ng for reporting.
- Security/Exec: block shell startup-file env injection (`BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `BASH_FUNC_*`, `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`) across config env ingestion, node-host inherited environment sanitization, and macOS exec host runtime to prevent pre-command execution from attacker-controlled environment variables. Thanks @tdjackey.
- Security/Exec (Windows): canonicalize `cmd.exe /c` command text across validation, approval binding, and audit/event rendering to prevent trailing-argument approval mismatches in `system.run`. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Hooks: block `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` traversal in webhook template path resolution to prevent prototype-chain payload data leakage in `messageTemplate` rendering. (#22213) Thanks @SleuthCo.

- Security/Agents: restrict local MEDIA tool attachments to core tools and the OpenClaw temp root to prevent untrusted MCP tool file exfiltration. Thanks @NucleiAv and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Net: strip sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Cookie2`) on cross-origin redirects in `fetchWithSsrFGuard` to prevent credential forwarding across origin boundaries. (#20313) Thanks @afurm.
- Security/Systemd: reject CR/LF in systemd unit environment values and fix argument escaping so generated units cannot be injected with extra directives. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Tools: add per-wrapper random IDs to untrusted-content markers from `wrapExternalContent`/`wrapWebContent`, preventing marker spoofing from escaping content boundaries. (#19009) Thanks @Whoaa512.
- Shared/Security: reject insecure deep links that use `ws://` non-loopback gateway URLs to prevent plaintext remote websocket configuration. (#21970) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Security: reject non-loopback `ws://` remote gateway URLs in macOS remote config to block insecure plaintext websocket endpoints. (#21971) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Browser/Security: block upload path symlink escapes so browser upload sources cannot traverse outside the allowed workspace via symlinked paths. (#21972) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/Dependencies: bump transitive `hono` usage to `4.11.10` to incorporate timing-safe authentication comparison hardening for `basicAuth`/`bearerAuth` (`GHSA-gq3j-xvxp-8hrf`). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Gateway: parse `X-Forwarded-For` with trust-preserving semantics when requests come from configured trusted proxies, preventing proxy-chain spoofing from influencing client IP classification and rate-limit identity. Thanks @AnthonyDiSanti and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sandbox: remove default `--no-sandbox` for the browser container entrypoint, add explicit opt-in via `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX` / `CLAWDBOT_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX`, and add security-audit checks for stale/missing sandbox browser Docker hash labels. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: require VNC password auth for noVNC observer sessions in the sandbox browser entrypoint, plumb per-container noVNC passwords from runtime, and emit short-lived noVNC observer token URLs while keeping loopback-only host port publishing. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: default browser sandbox containers to a dedicated Docker network (`openclaw-sandbox-browser`), add optional CDP ingress source-range restrictions, auto-create missing dedicated networks, and warn in `openclaw security --audit` when browser sandboxing runs on bridge without source-range limits. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee for reporting.

## 2026.2.19

- Dev tooling: align `oxfmt` local/CI formatting behavior. (#12579) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Security: strip hidden text from `web_fetch` extracted content to prevent indirect prompt injection, covering CSS-hidden elements, class-based hiding (sr-only, d-none, etc.), invisible Unicode, color:transparent, offscreen transforms, and non-content tags. (#8027, #21074) Thanks @hydro13 for the fix and @LucasAIBuilder for reporting.
- Agents/Streaming: keep assistant partial streaming active during reasoning streams, handle native `thinking_*` stream events consistently, dedupe mixed reasoning-end signals, and clear stale mutating tool errors after same-target retry success. (#20635) Thanks @obviyus.

- iOS/Chat: auto-resync chat history after reconnect sequence gaps, clear stale pending runs, and avoid dead-end manual refresh errors after transient disconnects. (#21135) thanks @mbelinky.
- UI/Usage: reload usage data immediately when timezone changes so Local/UTC toggles apply the selected date range without requiring a manual refresh. (#17774)
- iOS/Screen: move `WKWebView` lifecycle ownership into `ScreenWebView` coordinator and explicit attach/detach flow to reduce gesture/lifecycle crash risk (`__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:` paths) during screen tab updates. (#20366) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Onboarding: prevent pairing-status flicker during auto-resume by keeping resumed state transitions stable. (#20310) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Onboarding: stabilize pairing and reconnect behavior by resetting stale pairing request state on manual retry, disconnecting both operator and node gateways on operator failure, and avoiding duplicate pairing loops from operator transport identity attachment. (#20056) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Signing: restore local auto-selected signing-team overrides during iOS project generation by wiring `.local-signing.xcconfig` into the active signing config and emitting `OPENCLAW_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in local signing setup. (#19993) Thanks @ngutman.
- Telegram: unify message-like inbound handling so `message` and `channel_post` share the same dedupe/access/media pipeline and remain behaviorally consistent. (#20591) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: keep media-group processing resilient by skipping recoverable per-item download failures while still failing loud on non-recoverable media errors. (#20598) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Agents: gate exec/bash tool-failure warnings behind verbose mode so default Telegram replies stay clean while verbose sessions still surface diagnostics. (#20560) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Cron/Heartbeat: honor explicit Telegram topic targets in cron and heartbeat delivery (`<chatId>:topic:<threadId>`) so scheduled sends land in the configured topic instead of the last active thread. (#19367) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Telegram/DM routing: prevent DM inbound origin metadata from leaking into main-session `lastRoute` updates and normalize DM `lastRoute.to` to provider-prefixed `telegram:<chatId>`. (#19491) thanks @guirguispierre.
- Gateway/Daemon: forward `TMPDIR` into installed service environments so macOS LaunchAgent gateway runs can open SQLite temp/journal files reliably instead of failing with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`. (#20512) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Agents/Billing: include the active model that produced a billing error in user-facing billing messages (for example, `OpenAI (gpt-5.3)`) across payload, failover, and lifecycle error paths, so users can identify exactly which key needs credits. (#20510) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/TUI: honor `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` for `chat.send` by removing the hardcoded block-streaming disable override, so replies can use configured block-mode delivery. (#19693) Thanks @neipor.

- Scripts: update clawdock helper command support to include `docker-compose.extra.yml` where available. (#17094) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Lobster/Config: remove Lobster executable-path overrides (`lobsterPath`), require PATH-based execution, and add focused Windows wrapper-resolution tests to keep shell-free behavior stable.
- Gateway/WebChat: block `sessions.patch` and `sessions.delete` for WebChat clients so session-store mutations stay restricted to non-WebChat operator flows. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Gateway: clarify launchctl GUI domain bootstrap failure on macOS. (#13795) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Lobster/CI: fix flaky test Windows cmd shim script resolution. (#20833) Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Gateway/Hooks: run BOOT.md startup checks per configured agent scope, including per-agent session-key resolution, startup-hook regression coverage, and non-success boot outcome logging for diagnosability. (#20569) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Protocol/Apple: regenerate Swift gateway models for `push.test` so `pnpm protocol:check` stays green on main. Thanks @mbelinky.
- Sandbox/Registry: serialize container and browser registry writes with shared file locks and atomic replacement to prevent lost updates and delete rollback races from desyncing `sandbox list`, `prune`, and `recreate --all`. Thanks @kexinoh.
- OTEL/diagnostics-otel: complete OpenTelemetry v2 API migration. (#12897) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Cron/Webhooks: protect cron webhook POST delivery with SSRF-guarded outbound fetch (`fetchWithSsrFGuard`) to block private/metadata destinations before request dispatch. Thanks @Adam55A-code.

- Security/Windows Daemon: harden Scheduled Task `gateway.cmd` generation by quoting cmd metacharacter arguments, escaping `%`/`!` expansions, and rejecting CR/LF in arguments, descriptions, and environment assignments (`set "KEY=VALUE"`), preventing command injection in Windows daemon startup scripts. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Canvas: replace shared-IP fallback auth with node-scoped session capability URLs for `/__openclaw__/canvas/*` and `/__openclaw__/a2ui/*`, fail closed when trusted-proxy requests omit forwarded client headers, and add IPv6/proxy-header regression coverage. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Net: enforce strict dotted-decimal IPv4 literals in SSRF checks and fail closed on unsupported legacy forms (octal/hex/short/packed, for example `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1`, `2130706433`) before DNS lookup.
- Security/Discord: enforce trusted-sender guild permission checks for moderation actions (`timeout`, `kick`, `ban`) and ignore untrusted `senderUserId` params to prevent privilege escalation in tool-driven flows. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/ACP+Exec: add `openclaw acp --token-file/--password-file` secret-file support (with inline secret flag warnings), redact ACP working-directory prefixes to `~` home-relative paths, constrain exec script preflight file inspection to the effective `workdir` boundary, and add security-audit warnings when `tools.exec.host="sandbox"` is configured while sandbox mode is off.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: enforce runtime/package path containment with realpath checks so `openclaw.extensions`, `openclaw.hooks`, and hook handler modules cannot escape their trusted roots via traversal or symlinks.
- Security/Discord: centralize trusted sender checks for moderation actions in message-action dispatch, share moderation command parsing across handlers, and clarify permission helpers with explicit any/all semantics.
- Security/ACP: harden ACP bridge session management with duplicate-session refresh, idle-session reaping, oldest-idle soft-cap eviction, and burst rate limiting on session creation to reduce local DoS risk without disrupting normal IDE usage.
- Security/ACP: bound ACP prompt text payloads to 2 MiB before gateway forwarding, account for join separator bytes during pre-concatenation size checks, and avoid stale active-run session state when oversized prompts are rejected. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: add optional `--pin` for npm plugin/hook installs, persist resolved npm metadata (`name`, `version`, `spec`, integrity, shasum, timestamp), warn/confirm on integrity drift during updates, and extend `openclaw security audit` to flag unpinned specs, missing integrity metadata, and install-record version drift.
- Security/Plugins: harden plugin discovery by blocking unsafe candidates (root escapes, world-writable paths, suspicious ownership), add startup warnings when `plugins.allow` is empty with discoverable non-bundled plugins, and warn on loaded plugins without install/load-path provenance.
- Security/Gateway: rate-limit control-plane write RPCs (`config.apply`, `config.patch`, `update.run`) to 3 requests per minute per `deviceId+clientIp`, add restart single-flight coalescing plus a 30-second restart cooldown, and log actor/device/ip with changed-path audit details for config/update-triggered restarts.
- Security/Webhooks: harden Feishu and Zalo webhook ingress with webhook-mode token preconditions, loopback-default Feishu bind host, JSON content-type enforcement, per-path rate limiting, replay dedupe for Zalo events, constant-time Zalo secret comparison, and anomaly status counters.
- Security/Plugins: for the next npm release, clarify plugin trust boundary and keep `runtime.system.runCommandWithTimeout` available by default for trusted in-process plugins. Thanks @markmusson for reporting.
- Security/Skills: for the next npm release, reject symlinks during skill packaging to prevent external file inclusion in distributed `.skill` archives. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: fail startup when `hooks.token` matches `gateway.auth.token` so hooks and gateway token reuse is rejected at boot. (#20813) Thanks @coygeek.
- Security/Network: block plaintext `ws://` connections to non-loopback hosts and require secure websocket transport elsewhere. (#20803) Thanks @jscaldwell55.
- Security/Config: parse frontmatter YAML using the YAML 1.2 core schema to avoid implicit coercion of `on`/`off`-style values. (#20857) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Security/Discord: escape backticks in exec-approval embed content to prevent markdown formatting injection via command text. (#20854) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Security/Agents: replace shell-based `execSync` usage with `execFileSync` in command lookup helpers to eliminate shell argument interpolation risk. (#20655) Thanks @mahanandhi.
- Security/Media: use `crypto.randomBytes()` for temp file names and set owner-only permissions for TTS temp files. (#20654) Thanks @mahanandhi.
- Security/Gateway: set baseline security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`) on gateway HTTP responses. (#10526) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/iMessage: harden remote attachment SSH/SCP handling by requiring strict host-key verification, validating `channels.imessage.remoteHost` as `host`/`user@host`, and rejecting unsafe host tokens from config or auto-detection. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: prevent path traversal in Feishu inbound media temp-file writes by replacing key-derived temp filenames with UUID-based names. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: escape mention regex metacharacters in `stripBotMention` so crafted mention metadata cannot trigger regex injection or ReDoS during inbound message parsing. (#20916) Thanks @orlyjamie for the fix and @allsmog for reporting.
- LINE/Security: harden inbound media temp-file naming by using UUID-based temp paths for downloaded media instead of external message IDs. (#20792) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/Media: harden local media ingestion against TOCTOU/symlink swap attacks by pinning reads to a single file descriptor with symlink rejection and inode/device verification in `saveMediaSource`. Thanks @dorjoos for reporting.
- Security/Lobster (Windows): for the next npm release, remove shell-based fallback when launching Lobster wrappers (`.cmd`/`.bat`) and switch to explicit argv execution with wrapper entrypoint resolution, preventing command injection while preserving Windows wrapper compatibility. Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Exec: require `tools.exec.safeBins` binaries to resolve from trusted bin directories (system defaults plus gateway startup `PATH`) so PATH-hijacked trojan binaries cannot bypass allowlist checks. Thanks @jackhax for reporting.
- Security/Exec: remove file-existence oracle behavior from `tools.exec.safeBins` by using deterministic argv-only stdin-safe validation and blocking file-oriented flags (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`) so allow/deny results no longer disclose host file presence. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Browser: route browser URL navigation through one SSRF-guarded validation path for tab-open/CDP-target/Playwright navigation flows and block private/metadata destinations by default (configurable via `browser.ssrfPolicy`). Thanks @dorjoos for reporting.
- Security/Exec: for the next npm release, harden safe-bin stdin-only enforcement by blocking output/recursive flags (`sort -o/--output`, grep recursion) and tightening default safe bins to remove `sort`/`grep`, preventing safe-bin allowlist bypass for file writes/recursive reads. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Exec: block grep safe-bin positional operand bypass by setting grep positional budget to zero, so `-e/--regexp` cannot smuggle bare filename reads (for example `.env`) via ambiguous positionals; safe-bin grep patterns must come from `-e/--regexp`. Thanks @athuljayaram for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Agents: remove implicit admin scopes from agent tool gateway calls by classifying methods to least-privilege operator scopes, and enforce owner-only tooling (`cron`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) through centralized tool-policy wrappers plus tool metadata to prevent non-owner DM privilege escalation. Ships in the next npm release. Thanks @Adam55A-code for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: centralize gateway method-scope authorization and default non-CLI gateway callers to least-privilege method scopes, with explicit CLI scope handling, full core-handler scope classification coverage, and regression guards to prevent scope drift.
- Security/Net: block SSRF bypass via NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`, `64:ff9b:1::/48`), 6to4 (`2002::/16`), and Teredo (`2001:0000::/32`) IPv6 transition addresses, and fail closed on IPv6 parse errors. Thanks @jackhax.

- Discord: add per-button `allowedUsers` allowlist for interactive components to restrict who can click buttons. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Gateway: separate per-job webhook delivery (`delivery.mode = "webhook"`) from announce delivery, enforce valid HTTP(S) webhook URLs, and keep a temporary legacy `notify + cron.webhook` fallback for stored jobs. (#17901) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Cron/CLI: add deterministic default stagger for recurring top-of-hour cron schedules (including 6-field seconds cron), auto-migrate existing jobs to persisted `schedule.staggerMs`, and add `openclaw cron add/edit --stagger <duration>` plus `--exact` overrides for per-job timing control.

### Fixes

- Agents/Antigravity: preserve unsigned Claude thinking blocks as plain text instead of dropping them during transcript sanitization, preventing reasoning context loss while avoiding `thinking.signature` request rejections.
- Agents/Google: clean tool JSON Schemas for `google-antigravity` the same as `google-gemini-cli` before Cloud Code Assist requests, preventing Claude tool calls from failing with `patternProperties` 400 errors. (#19860)
- Tests/Telegram: add regression coverage for command-menu sync that asserts all `setMyCommands` entries are Telegram-safe and hyphen-normalized across native/custom/plugin command sources. (#19703) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image: collapse resize diagnostics to one line per image and include visible pixel/byte size details in the log message for faster triage.
- Auth/Cooldowns: clear all usage stats fields (`disabledUntil`, `disabledReason`, `failureCounts`) in `clearAuthProfileCooldown` so manual cooldown resets fully recover billing-disabled profiles without requiring direct file edits. (#19211) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents/Subagents: preemptively guard accumulated tool-result context before model calls by truncating oversized outputs and compacting oldest tool-result messages to avoid context-window overflow crashes. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents/CLI: fail `sessions_spawn` when subagent model patching is rejected, allow subagent model patch defaults from `subagents.model`, and keep `sessions list`/`status` model reporting aligned to runtime model resolution. (#18660) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents/Subagents: add explicit subagent guidance to recover from `[compacted: tool output removed to free context]` / `[truncated: output exceeded context limit]` markers by re-reading with smaller chunks instead of full-file `cat`. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: make `read` auto-page across chunks (when no explicit `limit` is provided) and scale its per-call output budget from model `contextWindow`, so larger contexts can read more before context guards kick in. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: strip duplicated `read` truncation payloads from tool-result `details` and make pre-call context guarding account for heavy tool-result metadata, so repeated `read` calls no longer bypass compaction and overflow model context windows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Reply threading: keep reply context sticky across streamed/split chunks and preserve `replyToId` on all chunk sends across shared and channel-specific delivery paths (including iMessage, BlueBubbles, Telegram, Discord, and Matrix), so follow-up bubbles stay attached to the same referenced message. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Agent: defer transient lifecycle `error` snapshots with a short grace window so `agent.wait` does not resolve early during retry/failover. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Presence: centralize presence snapshot broadcasts and unify runtime version precedence (`OPENCLAW_VERSION` > `OPENCLAW_SERVICE_VERSION` > `npm_package_version`) so self-presence and websocket `hello-ok` report consistent versions.
- Hooks/Automation: bridge outbound/inbound message lifecycle into internal hook events (`message:received`, `message:sent`) with session-key correlation guards, while keeping per-payload success/error reporting accurate for chunked and best-effort deliveries. (PR #9387)
- Media understanding: honor `agents.defaults.imageModel` during auto-discovery so implicit image analysis uses configured primary/fallback image models. (PR #7607)
- iOS/Onboarding: stop auth Step 3 retry-loop churn by pausing reconnect attempts on unauthorized/missing-token gateway errors and keeping auth/pairing issue state sticky during manual retry. (#19153) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Voice-call: auto-end calls when media streams disconnect to prevent stuck active calls. (#18435) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Voice call/Gateway: prevent overlapping closed-loop turn races with per-call turn locking, route transcript dedupe via source-aware fingerprints with strict cache eviction bounds, and harden `voicecall latency` stats for large logs without spread-operator stack overflow. (#19140) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: route ChatSheet RPCs through the operator session instead of the node session to avoid node-role authorization failures for `chat.history`, `chat.send`, and `sessions.list`. (#19320) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Update: correct the Sparkle appcast version for 2026.2.15 so updates are offered again. (#18201)

- Providers: improve error messaging for unconfigured local `ollama`/`vllm` providers. (#18183) Thanks @arosstale.
- TTS: surface all provider errors instead of only the last error in aggregated failures. (#17964) Thanks @ikari-pl.

- Gateway/Channels: wire `gateway.channelHealthCheckMinutes` into strict config validation, treat implicit account status as managed for health checks, and harden channel auto-restart flow (preserve restart-attempt caps across crash loops, propagate enabled/configured runtime flags, and stop pending restart backoff after manual stop). Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/WebChat: hard-cap `chat.history` oversized payloads by truncating high-cost fields and replacing over-budget entries with placeholders, so history fetches stay within configured byte limits and avoid chat UI freezes. (#18505)
- UI/Usage: replace lingering undefined `var(--text-muted)` usage with `var(--muted)` in usage date-range and chart styles to keep muted text visible across themes. (#17975) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Usage: preserve selected-range totals when timeline data is downsampled by bucket-aggregating timeseries points (instead of dropping intermediate points), so filtered tokens/cost stay accurate. (#17959) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Sessions: refresh the sessions table only after successful deletes and preserve delete errors on cancel/failure paths, so deleted sessions disappear automatically without masking delete failures. (#18507)
- Scripts/UI/Windows: fix `pnpm ui:*` spawn `EINVAL` failures by restoring shell-backed launch for `.cmd`/`.bat` runners, narrowing shell usage to launcher types that require it, and rejecting unsafe forwarded shell metacharacters in UI script args. (#18594)
- Hooks/Session-memory: recover `/new` conversation summaries when session pointers are reset-path or missing `sessionFile`, and consistently prefer the newest `.jsonl.reset.*` transcript candidate for fallback extraction. (#18088)
- Auto-reply/Sessions: prevent stale thread ID leakage into non-thread sessions so replies stay in the main DM after topic interactions. (#18528) Thanks @j2h4u.
- Slack: restrict forwarded-attachment ingestion to explicit shared-message attachments and skip non-Slack forwarded `image_url` fetches, preventing non-forward attachment unfurls from polluting inbound agent context while preserving forwarded message handling.
- Feishu: detect bot mentions in post messages with embedded docs when `message.mentions` is empty. (#18074) Thanks @popomore.
- Agents/Sessions: align session lock watchdog hold windows with run and compaction timeout budgets (plus grace), preventing valid long-running turns from being force-unlocked mid-run while still recovering hung lock owners. (#18060)
- Cron: preserve default model fallbacks for cron agent runs when only `model.primary` is overridden, so failover still follows configured fallbacks unless explicitly cleared with `fallbacks: []`. (#18210) Thanks @mahsumaktas.
- Cron/Isolation: treat non-finite `nextRunAtMs` as missing and repair isolated `every` anchor fallback so legacy jobs without valid timestamps self-heal and scheduler wake timing remains valid. (#19469) Thanks @guirguispierre.
- Cron: route text-only announce output through the main session announce flow via runSubagentAnnounceFlow so cron text-only output remains visible to the initiating session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron: treat `timeoutSeconds: 0` as no-timeout (not clamped to 1), ensuring long-running cron runs are not prematurely terminated. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron announce injection now targets the session determined by delivery config (`to` + channel) instead of defaulting to the current session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron/Heartbeat: canonicalize session-scoped reminder `sessionKey` routing and preserve explicit flat `sessionKey` cron tool inputs, preventing enqueue/wake namespace drift for session-targeted reminders. (#18637) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Cron/Webhooks: reuse existing session IDs for webhook/cron runs when the session key is stable and still fresh, preserving conversation history. (#18031) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Cron: prevent spin loops when cron jobs complete within the scheduled second by advancing the next run and enforcing a minimum refire gap. (#18073) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- OpenClawKit/iOS ChatUI: accept canonical session-key completion events for local pending runs and preserve message IDs across history refreshes, preventing stuck "thinking" state and message flicker after gateway replies. (#18165) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Onboarding: add QR-first onboarding wizard with setup-code deep link support, pairing/auth issue guidance, and device-pair QR generation improvements for Telegram/Web/TUI fallback flows. (#18162) Thanks @mbelinky and @Marvae.
- iOS/Gateway: stabilize connect/discovery state handling, add onboarding reset recovery in Settings, and fix iOS gateway-controller coverage for command-surface and last-connection persistence behavior. (#18164) Thanks @mbelinky.

- iOS/Location: restore the significant location monitor implementation (service hooks + protocol surface + ATS key alignment) after merge drift so iOS builds compile again. (#18260) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Signing: auto-select local Apple Development team during iOS project generation/build, prefer the canonical OpenClaw team when available, and support local per-machine signing overrides without committing team IDs. (#18421) Thanks @ngutman.
- Discord/Telegram: make per-account message action gates effective for both action listing and execution, and preserve top-level gate restrictions when account overrides only specify a subset of `actions` keys (account key -> base key -> default fallback). (#18494)
- Telegram: keep DM-topic replies and draft previews in the originating private-chat topic by preserving positive `message_thread_id` values for DM threads. (#18586) Thanks @sebslight.
- Telegram: preserve private-chat topic `message_thread_id` on outbound sends (message/sticker/poll), keep thread-not-found retry fallback, and avoid masking `chat not found` routing errors. (#18993) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: prevent duplicate media delivery when the model uses the `message send` tool with media, by skipping media extraction from messaging tool results since the tool already sent the message directly. (#18270)
- Discord: route `audioAsVoice` auto-replies through the voice message API so opt-in audio renders as voice messages. (#18041) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Discord: skip auto-thread creation in forum/media/voice/stage channels and keep group session last-route metadata fresh to avoid invalid thread API errors and lost follow-up sends. (#18098) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Discord/Commands: normalize `commands.allowFrom` entries with `user:`/`discord:`/`pk:` prefixes and `<@id>` mentions so command authorization matches Discord allowlist behavior. (#18042)
- Telegram: keep draft-stream preview replies attached to the user message for `replyToMode: "all"` in groups and DMs, preserving threaded reply context from preview through finalization. (#17880) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: prevent streaming final replies from being overwritten by later final/error payloads, and suppress fallback tool-error warnings when a recovered assistant answer already exists after tool calls. (#17883) Thanks @Marvae and @obviyus.
- Telegram: debounce the first draft-stream preview update (30-char threshold) and finalize short responses by editing the stop-time preview message, improving first push notifications and avoiding duplicate final sends. (#18148) Thanks @Marvae.
- Telegram: disable block streaming when `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `off`, preventing newline/content-block replies from splitting into multiple messages. (#17679) Thanks @saivarunk.
- Telegram: keep `streamMode: "partial"` draft previews in a single message across assistant-message/reasoning boundaries, preventing duplicate preview bubbles during partial-mode tool-call turns. (#18956) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: normalize native command names for Telegram menu registration (`-` -> `_`) to avoid `BOT_COMMAND_INVALID` command-menu wipeouts, and log failed command syncs instead of silently swallowing them. (#19257) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Telegram: route non-abort slash commands on the normal chat/topic sequential lane while keeping true abort requests (`/stop`, `stop`) on the control lane, preventing command/reply race conditions from control-lane bypass. (#17899) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: ignore `<media:...>` placeholder lines when extracting `MEDIA:` tool-result paths, preventing false local-file reads and dropped replies. (#18510) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: skip retries when inbound media `getFile` fails with Telegram's 20MB limit and continue processing message text, avoiding dropped messages for oversized attachments. (#18531) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Telegram: clear stored polling offsets when bot tokens change or accounts are deleted, preventing stale offsets after token rotations. (#18233)
- Telegram: enable `autoSelectFamily` by default on Node.js 22+ so IPv4 fallback works on broken IPv6 networks. (#18272) Thanks @nacho9900.
- Auto-reply/TTS: keep tool-result media delivery enabled in group chats and native command sessions (while still suppressing tool summary text) so `NO_REPLY` follow-ups do not drop successful TTS audio. (#17991) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/Tools: deliver tool-result media even when verbose tool output is off so media attachments are not dropped. (#16679)
- Discord: optimize reaction notification handling to skip unnecessary message fetches in `off`/`all`/`allowlist` modes, streamline reaction routing, and improve reaction emoji formatting. (#18248) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow and @victorGPT.
- CLI/Pairing: make `openclaw qr --remote` prefer `gateway.remote.url` over tailscale/public URL resolution and register the `openclaw clawbot qr` legacy alias path. (#18091)
- CLI/QR: restore fail-fast validation for `openclaw qr --remote` when neither `gateway.remote.url` nor tailscale `serve`/`funnel` is configured, preventing unusable remote pairing QR flows. (#18166) Thanks @mbelinky.
- CLI: fix parent/subcommand option collisions across gateway, daemon, update, ACP, and browser command flows, while preserving legacy `browser set headers --json <payload>` compatibility.
- CLI/Doctor: ensure `openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive --yes` exits promptly after completion so one-shot automation no longer hangs. (#18502)
- CLI/Doctor: auto-repair `dmPolicy="open"` configs missing wildcard allowlists and write channel-correct repair paths (including `channels.googlechat.dm.allowFrom`) so `openclaw doctor --fix` no longer leaves Google Chat configs invalid after attempted repair. (#18544)
- CLI/Doctor: detect gateway service token drift when the gateway token is only provided via environment variables, keeping service repairs aligned after token rotation.
- Gateway/Update: prevent restart crash loops after failed self-updates by restarting only on successful updates, stopping early on failed install/build steps, and running `openclaw doctor --fix` during updates to sanitize config. (#18131) Thanks @RamiNoodle733.
- Gateway/Update: preserve update.run restart delivery context so post-update status replies route back to the initiating channel/thread. (#18267) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Update: run a standalone restart helper after updates, honoring service-name overrides and reporting restart initiation separately from confirmed restarts. (#18050)
- CLI/Daemon: warn when a gateway restart sees a stale service token so users can reinstall with `openclaw gateway install --force`, and skip drift warnings for non-gateway service restarts. (#18018)
- CLI/Daemon: prefer the active version-manager Node when installing daemons and include macOS version-manager bin directories in the service PATH so launchd services resolve user-managed runtimes.
- CLI/Status: fix `openclaw status --all` token summaries for bot-token-only channels so Mattermost/Zalo no longer show a bot+app warning. (#18527) Thanks @echo931.
- CLI/Configure: make the `/model picker` allowlist prompt searchable with tokenized matching in `openclaw configure` so users can filter huge model lists by typing terms like `gpt-5.2 openai/`. (#19010) Thanks @bjesuiter.
- CLI/Message: preserve `--components` JSON payloads in `openclaw message send` so Discord component payloads are no longer dropped. (#18222) Thanks @saurabhchopade.
- Voice Call: add an optional stale call reaper (`staleCallReaperSeconds`) to end stuck calls when enabled. (#18437)
- Auto-reply/Subagents: propagate group context (`groupId`, `groupChannel`, `space`) when spawning via `/subagents spawn`, matching tool-triggered subagent spawn behavior.
- Subagents: route nested announce results back to the parent session after the parent run ends, falling back only when the parent session is deleted. (#18043) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Subagents: cap announce retry loops with max attempts and expiry to prevent infinite retry spam after deferred announces. (#18444)
- Agents/Tools/exec: add a preflight guard that detects likely shell env var injection (e.g. `$DM_JSON`, `$TMPDIR`) in Python/Node scripts before execution, preventing recurring cron failures and wasted tokens when models emit mixed shell+language source. (#12836)
- Agents/Tools/exec: treat normal non-zero exit codes as completed and append the exit code to tool output to avoid false tool-failure warnings. (#18425)
- Agents/Tools: make loop detection progress-aware and phased by hard-blocking known `process(action=poll|log)` no-progress loops, warning on generic identical-call repeats, warning + no-progress-blocking ping-pong alternation loops (10/20), coalescing repeated warning spam into threshold buckets (including canonical ping-pong pairs), adding a global circuit breaker at 30 no-progress repeats, and emitting structured diagnostic `tool.loop` warning/error events for loop actions. (#16808) Thanks @akramcodez and @beca-oc.
- Agents/Hooks: preserve the `before_tool_call` wrapped-marker across abort-signal tool wrapping so the hook runs once per tool call in normal agent sessions. (#16852) Thanks @sreuter.
- Agents/Tests: add `before_message_write` persistence regression coverage for block/mutate behavior (including synthetic tool-result flushes) and thrown-hook fallback persistence. (#18197) Thanks @shakkernerd
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image tool: replace Anthropic-incompatible union schema with explicit `image` (single) and `images` (multi) parameters, keeping tool schemas `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`-free while preserving multi-image analysis support. (#18551, #18566) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Agents/Models: probe the primary model when its auth-profile cooldown is near expiry (with per-provider throttling), so runs recover from temporary rate limits without staying on fallback models until restart. (#17478) Thanks @PlayerGhost.
- Agents/Failover: classify provider abort stop-reason errors (`Unhandled stop reason: abort`, `stop reason: abort`, `reason: abort`) as timeout-class failures so configured model fallback chains trigger instead of surfacing raw abort failures. (#18618) Thanks @sauerdaniel.
- Models/CLI: sync auth-profiles credentials into agent `auth.json` before registry availability checks so `openclaw models list --all` reports auth correctly for API-key/token providers, normalize provider-id aliases when bridging credentials, and skip expired token mirrors. (#18610, #18615)
- Agents/Context: raise default total bootstrap prompt cap from `24000` to `150000` chars (keeping `bootstrapMaxChars` at `20000`), include total-cap visibility in `/context`, and mark truncation from injected-vs-raw sizes so total-cap clipping is reflected accurately.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Cron: preserve per-job schedule-error isolation in post-run maintenance recompute so malformed sibling jobs no longer abort persistence of successful runs. (#17852) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Gateway/Config: prevent `config.patch` object-array merges from falling back to full-array replacement when some patch entries lack `id`, so partial `agents.list` updates no longer drop unrelated agents. (#17989) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Auth: trim whitespace around trusted proxy entries before matching so configured proxies with stray spaces still authorize. (#18084) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Config/Discord: require string IDs in Discord allowlists, keep onboarding inputs string-only, and add doctor repair for numeric entries. (#18220) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Sessions: create new session transcript JSONL files with user-only (`0o600`) permissions and extend `openclaw security audit --fix` to remediate existing transcript file permissions.
- Sessions/Maintenance: archive transcripts when pruning stale sessions, clean expired media in subdirectories, and purge `.deleted` transcript archives after the prune window to prevent disk leaks. (#18538)
- Infra/Fetch: ensure foreign abort-signal listener cleanup never masks original fetch successes/failures, while still preventing detached-finally unhandled rejection noise in `wrapFetchWithAbortSignal`. Thanks @Jackten.
- Heartbeat: allow suppressing tool error warning payloads during heartbeat runs via a new heartbeat config flag. (#18497) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Heartbeat: include sender metadata (From/To/Provider) in heartbeat prompts so model context matches the delivery target. (#18532) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Heartbeat/Telegram: strip configured `responsePrefix` before heartbeat ack detection (with boundary-safe matching) so prefixed `HEARTBEAT_OK` replies are correctly suppressed instead of leaking into DMs. (#18602)

## 2026.2.15

### Changes

- Discord: unlock rich interactive agent prompts with Components v2 (buttons, selects, modals, and attachment-backed file blocks) so for native interaction through Discord. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: components v2 UI + embeds passthrough + exec approval UX refinements (CV2 containers, button layout, Discord-forwarding skip). Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Plugins: expose `llm_input` and `llm_output` hook payloads so extensions can observe prompt/input context and model output usage details. (#16724) Thanks @SecondThread.
- Subagents: nested sub-agents (sub-sub-agents) with configurable depth. Set `agents.defaults.subagents.maxSpawnDepth: 2` to allow sub-agents to spawn their own children. Includes `maxChildrenPerAgent` limit (default 5), depth-aware tool policy, and proper announce chain routing. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Slack/Discord/Telegram: add per-channel ack reaction overrides (account/channel-level) to support platform-specific emoji formats. (#17092) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Telegram: add `channel_post` inbound support for channel-based bot-to-bot wake/trigger flows, with channel allowlist gating and message/media batching parity.
- Cron/Gateway: add finished-run webhook delivery toggle (`notify`) and dedicated webhook auth token support (`cron.webhookToken`) for outbound cron webhook posts. (#14535) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Channels: deduplicate probe/token resolution base types across core + extensions while preserving per-channel error typing. (#16986) Thanks @iyoda and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory: add MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) re-ranking for hybrid search diversity. Configurable via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.mmr`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Memory: add opt-in temporal decay for hybrid search scoring, with configurable half-life via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.temporalDecay`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.

### Fixes

- Discord: send initial content when creating non-forum threads so `thread-create` content is delivered. (#18117) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Security: replace deprecated SHA-1 sandbox configuration hashing with SHA-256 for deterministic sandbox cache identity and recreation checks. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Security/Logging: redact Telegram bot tokens from error messages and uncaught stack traces to prevent accidental secret leakage into logs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox/Security: block dangerous sandbox Docker config (bind mounts, host networking, unconfined seccomp/apparmor) to prevent container escape via config injection. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox: preserve array order in config hashing so order-sensitive Docker/browser settings trigger container recreation correctly. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Gateway/Security: redact sensitive session/path details from `status` responses for non-admin clients; full details remain available to `operator.admin`. (#8590) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Control UI: preserve requested operator scopes for Control UI bypass modes (`allowInsecureAuth` / `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`) when device identity is unavailable, preventing false `missing scope` failures on authenticated LAN/HTTP operator sessions. (#17682) Thanks @leafbird.
- LINE/Security: fail closed on webhook startup when channel token or channel secret is missing, and treat LINE accounts as configured only when both are present. (#17587) Thanks @davidahmann.
- Skills/Security: restrict `download` installer `targetDir` to the per-skill tools directory to prevent arbitrary file writes. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Skills/Linux: harden go installer fallback on apt-based systems by handling root/no-sudo environments safely, doing best-effort apt index refresh, and returning actionable errors instead of failing with spawn errors. (#17687) Thanks @mcrolly.
- Web Fetch/Security: cap downloaded response body size before HTML parsing to prevent memory exhaustion from oversized or deeply nested pages. Thanks @xuemian168.
- Config/Gateway: make sensitive-key whitelist suffix matching case-insensitive while preserving `passwordFile` path exemptions, preventing accidental redaction of non-secret config values like `maxTokens` and IRC password-file paths. (#16042) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Dev tooling: harden git `pre-commit` hook against option injection from malicious filenames (for example `--force`), preventing accidental staging of ignored files. Thanks @mrthankyou.
- Gateway/Agent: reject malformed `agent:`-prefixed session keys (for example, `agent:main`) in `agent` and `agent.identity.get` instead of silently resolving them to the default agent, preventing accidental cross-session routing. (#15707) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Chat: harden `chat.send` inbound message handling by rejecting null bytes, stripping unsafe control characters, and normalizing Unicode to NFC before dispatch. (#8593) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Send: return an actionable error when `send` targets internal-only `webchat`, guiding callers to use `chat.send` or a deliverable channel. (#15703) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Commands: keep webchat command authorization on the internal `webchat` context instead of inferring another provider from channel allowlists, fixing dropped `/new`/`/status` commands in Control UI when channel allowlists are configured. (#7189) Thanks @karlisbergmanis-lv.
- Control UI: prevent stored XSS via assistant name/avatar by removing inline script injection, serving bootstrap config as JSON, and enforcing `script-src 'self'`. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Agents/Security: sanitize workspace paths before embedding into LLM prompts (strip Unicode control/format chars) to prevent instruction injection via malicious directory names. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Agents/Sandbox: clarify system prompt path guidance so sandbox `bash/exec` uses container paths (for example `/workspace`) while file tools keep host-bridge mapping, avoiding first-attempt path misses from host-only absolute paths in sandbox command execution. (#17693) Thanks @app/juniordevbot.
- Agents/Context: apply configured model `contextWindow` overrides after provider discovery so `lookupContextTokens()` honors operator config values (including discovery-failure paths). (#17404) Thanks @michaelbship and @vignesh07.
- Agents/Context: derive `lookupContextTokens()` from auth-available model metadata and keep the smallest discovered context window for duplicate model ids, preventing cross-provider cache collisions from overestimating session context limits. (#17586) Thanks @githabideri and @vignesh07.
- Agents/OpenAI: force `store=true` for direct OpenAI Responses/Codex runs to preserve multi-turn server-side conversation state, while leaving proxy/non-OpenAI endpoints unchanged. (#16803) Thanks @mark9232 and @vignesh07.
- Memory/FTS: make `buildFtsQuery` Unicode-aware so non-ASCII queries (including CJK) produce keyword tokens instead of falling back to vector-only search. (#17672) Thanks @KinGP5471.
- Auto-reply/Compaction: resolve `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` placeholders with timezone-aware runtime dates and append a `Current time:` line to memory-flush turns, preventing wrong-year memory filenames without making the system prompt time-variant. (#17603, #17633) Thanks @nicholaspapadam-wq and @vignesh07.
- Auth/Cooldowns: auto-expire stale auth profile cooldowns when `cooldownUntil` or `disabledUntil` timestamps have passed, and reset `errorCount` so the next transient failure does not immediately escalate to a disproportionately long cooldown. Handles `cooldownUntil` and `disabledUntil` independently. (#3604) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents: return an explicit timeout error reply when an embedded run times out before producing any payloads, preventing silent dropped turns during slow cache-refresh transitions. (#16659) Thanks @liaosvcaf and @vignesh07.
- Group chats: always inject group chat context (name, participants, reply guidance) into the system prompt on every turn, not just the first. Prevents the model from losing awareness of which group it's in and incorrectly using the message tool to send to the same group. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Browser/Agents: when browser control service is unavailable, return explicit non-retry guidance (instead of "try again") so models do not loop on repeated browser tool calls until timeout. (#17673) Thanks @austenstone.
- Subagents: use child-run-based deterministic announce idempotency keys across direct and queued delivery paths (with legacy queued-item fallback) to prevent duplicate announce retries without collapsing distinct same-millisecond announces. (#17150) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Subagents/Models: preserve `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` when subagent sessions carry a model override, so subagent runs fail over to configured fallback models instead of retrying only the overridden primary model.
- Telegram: omit `message_thread_id` for DM sends/draft previews and keep forum-topic handling (`id=1` general omitted, non-general kept), preventing DM failures with `400 Bad Request: message thread not found`. (#10942) Thanks @garnetlyx.
- Telegram: replace inbound `<media:audio>` placeholder with successful preflight voice transcript in message body context, preventing placeholder-only prompt bodies for mention-gated voice messages. (#16789) Thanks @Limitless2023.
- Telegram: retry inbound media `getFile` calls (3 attempts with backoff) and gracefully fall back to placeholder-only processing when retries fail, preventing dropped voice/media messages on transient Telegram network errors. (#16154) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: finalize streaming preview replies in place instead of sending a second final message, preventing duplicate Telegram assistant outputs at stream completion. (#17218) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: preserve channel session continuity when runtime payloads omit `message.channelId` by falling back to event/raw `channel_id` values for routing/session keys, so same-channel messages keep history across turns/restarts. Also align diagnostics so active Discord runs no longer appear as `sessionKey=unknown`. (#17622) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Discord: dedupe native skill commands by skill name in multi-agent setups to prevent duplicated slash commands with `_2` suffixes. (#17365) Thanks @seewhyme.
- Discord: ensure role allowlist matching uses raw role IDs for message routing authorization. Thanks @xinhuagu.
- Discord: skip text-based exec approval forwarding in favor of Discord's component-based approval UI. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI/Agents: hide `BOOTSTRAP.md` in the Agents Files list after onboarding is completed, avoiding confusing missing-file warnings for completed workspaces. (#17491) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Gateway/Memory: initialize QMD startup sync for every configured agent (not just the default agent), so `memory.qmd.update.onBoot` is effective across multi-agent setups. (#17663) Thanks @HenryLoenwind.
- Auto-reply/WhatsApp/TUI/Web: when a final assistant message is `NO_REPLY` and a messaging tool send succeeded, mirror the delivered messaging-tool text into session-visible assistant output so TUI/Web no longer show `NO_REPLY` placeholders. (#7010) Thanks @Morrowind-Xie.
- Cron: infer `payload.kind="agentTurn"` for model-only `cron.update` payload patches, so partial agent-turn updates do not fail validation when `kind` is omitted. (#15664) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- TUI: make searchable-select filtering and highlight rendering ANSI-aware so queries ignore hidden escape codes and no longer corrupt ANSI styling sequences during match highlighting. (#4519) Thanks @bee4come.
- TUI/Windows: coalesce rapid single-line submit bursts in Git Bash into one multiline message as a fallback when bracketed paste is unavailable, preventing pasted multiline text from being split into multiple sends. (#4986) Thanks @adamkane.
- TUI: suppress false `(no output)` placeholders for non-local empty final events during concurrent runs, preventing external-channel replies from showing empty assistant bubbles while a local run is still streaming. (#5782) Thanks @LagWizard and @vignesh07.
- TUI: preserve copy-sensitive long tokens (URLs/paths/file-like identifiers) during wrapping and overflow sanitization so wrapped output no longer inserts spaces that corrupt copy/paste values. (#17515, #17466, #17505) Thanks @abe238, @trevorpan, and @JasonCry.
- CLI/Build: make legacy daemon CLI compatibility shim generation tolerant of minimal tsdown daemon export sets, while preserving restart/register compatibility aliases and surfacing explicit errors for unavailable legacy daemon commands. Thanks @vignesh07.

## 2026.2.14

### Changes

- Telegram: add poll sending via `openclaw message poll` (duration seconds, silent delivery, anonymity controls). (#16209) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Slack/Discord: add `dmPolicy` + `allowFrom` config aliases for DM access control; legacy `dm.policy` + `dm.allowFrom` keys remain supported and `openclaw doctor --fix` can migrate them.
- Discord: allow exec approval prompts to target channels or both DM+channel via `channels.discord.execApprovals.target`. (#16051) Thanks @leonnardo.
- Sandbox: add `sandbox.browser.binds` to configure browser-container bind mounts separately from exec containers. (#16230) Thanks @seheepeak.
- Discord: add debug logging for message routing decisions to improve `--debug` tracing. (#16202) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Agents: add optional `messages.suppressToolErrors` config to hide non-mutating tool-failure warnings from user-facing chat while still surfacing mutating failures. (#16620) Thanks @vai-oro.

### Fixes

- CLI/Installation: fix Docker installation hangs on macOS. (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Models: fix antigravity opus 4.6 availability follow-up. (#12845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sessions/Telegram: restrict session tool targeting by default to the current session tree (`tools.sessions.visibility`, default `tree`) with sandbox clamping, and pass configured per-account Telegram webhook secrets in webhook mode when no explicit override is provided. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- CLI/Plugins: ensure `openclaw message send` exits after successful delivery across plugin-backed channels so one-shot sends do not hang. (#16491) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Plugins: run registered plugin `gateway_stop` hooks before `openclaw message` exits (success and failure paths), so plugin-backed channels can clean up one-shot CLI resources. (#16580) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- WhatsApp: honor per-account `dmPolicy` overrides (account-level settings now take precedence over channel defaults for inbound DMs). (#10082) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram: when `channels.telegram.commands.native` is `false`, exclude plugin commands from `setMyCommands` menu registration while keeping plugin slash handlers callable. (#15132) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- LINE: return 200 OK for Developers Console "Verify" requests (`{"events":[]}`) without `X-Line-Signature`, while still requiring signatures for real deliveries. (#16582) Thanks @arosstale.
- Cron: deliver text-only output directly when `delivery.to` is set so cron recipients get full output instead of summaries. (#16360) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Slack: preserve agent identity (name and icon) when cron jobs deliver outbound messages. (#16242) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Media: accept `MEDIA:`-prefixed paths (lenient whitespace) when loading outbound media to prevent `ENOENT` for tool-returned local media paths. (#13107) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Media understanding: treat binary `application/vnd.*`/zip/octet-stream attachments as non-text (while keeping vendor `+json`/`+xml` text-eligible) so Office/ZIP files are not inlined into prompt body text. (#16513) Thanks @rmramsey32.
- Agents: deliver tool result media (screenshots, images, audio) to channels regardless of verbose level. (#11735) Thanks @strelov1.
- Auto-reply/Block streaming: strip leading whitespace from streamed block replies so messages starting with blank lines no longer deliver visible leading empty lines. (#16422) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- Auto-reply/Queue: keep queued followups and overflow summaries when drain attempts fail, then retry delivery instead of dropping messages on transient errors. (#16771) Thanks @mmhzlrj.
- Agents/Image tool: allow workspace-local image paths by including the active workspace directory in local media allowlists, and trust sandbox-validated paths in image loaders to prevent false "not under an allowed directory" rejections. (#15541)
- Agents/Image tool: propagate the effective workspace root into tool wiring so workspace-local image paths are accepted by default when running without an explicit `workspaceDir`. (#16722)
- BlueBubbles: include sender identity in group chat envelopes and pass clean message text to the agent prompt, aligning with iMessage/Signal formatting. (#16210) Thanks @zerone0x.
- CLI: fix lazy core command registration so top-level maintenance commands (`doctor`, `dashboard`, `reset`, `uninstall`) resolve correctly instead of exposing a non-functional `maintenance` placeholder command.
- CLI/Dashboard: when `gateway.bind=lan`, generate localhost dashboard URLs to satisfy browser secure-context requirements while preserving non-LAN bind behavior. (#16434) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- TUI/Gateway: resolve local gateway target URL from `gateway.bind` mode (tailnet/lan) instead of hardcoded localhost so `openclaw tui` connects when gateway is non-loopback. (#16299) Thanks @cortexuvula.
- TUI: honor explicit `--session <key>` in `openclaw tui` even when `session.scope` is `global`, so named sessions no longer collapse into shared global history. (#16575) Thanks @cinqu.
- TUI: use available terminal width for session name display in searchable select lists. (#16238) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- TUI: preserve in-flight streaming replies when a different run finalizes concurrently (avoid clearing active run or reloading history mid-stream). (#10704) Thanks @axschr73.
- TUI: keep pre-tool streamed text visible when later tool-boundary deltas temporarily omit earlier text blocks. (#6958) Thanks @KrisKind75.
- TUI: sanitize ANSI/control-heavy history text, redact binary-like lines, and split pathological long unbroken tokens before rendering to prevent startup crashes on binary attachment history. (#13007) Thanks @wilkinspoe.
- TUI: harden render-time sanitizer for narrow terminals by chunking moderately long unbroken tokens and adding fast-path sanitization guards to reduce overhead on normal text. (#5355) Thanks @tingxueren.
- TUI: render assistant body text in terminal default foreground (instead of fixed light ANSI color) so contrast remains readable on light themes such as Solarized Light. (#16750) Thanks @paymog.
- TUI/Hooks: pass explicit reset reason (`new` vs `reset`) through `sessions.reset` and emit internal command hooks for gateway-triggered resets so `/new` hook workflows fire in TUI/webchat.
- Gateway/Agent: route bare `/new` and `/reset` through `sessions.reset` before running the fresh-session greeting prompt, so reset commands clear the current session in-place instead of falling through to normal agent runs. (#16732) Thanks @kdotndot and @vignesh07.
- Cron: prevent `cron list`/`cron status` from silently skipping past-due recurring jobs by using maintenance recompute semantics. (#16156) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Cron: repair missing/corrupt `nextRunAtMs` for the updated job without globally recomputing unrelated due jobs during `cron update`. (#15750)
- Cron: treat persisted jobs with missing `enabled` as enabled by default across update/list/timer due-path checks, and add regression coverage for missing-`enabled` store records. (#15433) Thanks @eternauta1337.
- Cron: skip missed-job replay on startup for jobs interrupted mid-run (stale `runningAtMs` markers), preventing restart loops for self-restarting jobs such as update tasks. (#16694) Thanks @sbmilburn.
- Heartbeat/Cron: treat cron-tagged queued system events as cron reminders even on interval wakes, so isolated cron announce summaries no longer run under the default heartbeat prompt. (#14947) Thanks @archedark-ada and @vignesh07.
- Discord: prefer gateway guild id when logging inbound messages so cached-miss guilds do not appear as `guild=dm`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: treat empty per-guild `channels: {}` config maps as no channel allowlist (not deny-all), so `groupPolicy: "open"` guilds without explicit channel entries continue to receive messages. (#16714) Thanks @xqliu.
- Models/CLI: guard `models status` string trimming paths to prevent crashes from malformed non-string config values. (#16395) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Gateway/Subagents: preserve queued announce items and summary state on delivery errors, retry failed announce drains, and avoid dropping unsent announcements on timeout/failure. (#16729) Thanks @Clawdette-Workspace.
- Gateway/Config: make `config.patch` merge object arrays by `id` (for example `agents.list`) instead of replacing the whole array, so partial agent updates do not silently delete unrelated agents. (#6766) Thanks @lightclient.
- Webchat/Prompts: stop injecting direct-chat `conversation_label` into inbound untrusted metadata context blocks, preventing internal label noise from leaking into visible chat replies. (#16556) Thanks @nberardi.
- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id`, `chat_id`, `reply_to_id`, and optional `message_id_full` metadata fields so action tools (for example reactions) can target the triggering message without relying on user text. (#17662) Thanks @MaikiMolto.
- Gateway/Sessions: abort active embedded runs and clear queued session work before `sessions.reset`, returning unavailable if the run does not stop in time. (#16576) Thanks @Grynn.
- Sessions/Agents: harden transcript path resolution for mismatched agent context by preserving explicit store roots and adding safe absolute-path fallback to the correct agent sessions directory. (#16288) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: add a safety timeout around embedded `session.compact()` to ensure stalled compaction runs settle and release blocked session lanes. (#16331) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Agents/Tools: make required-parameter validation errors list missing fields and instruct: "Supply correct parameters before retrying," reducing repeated invalid tool-call loops (for example `read({})`). (#14729)
- Agents: keep unresolved mutating tool failures visible until the same action retry succeeds, scope mutation-error surfacing to mutating calls (including `session_status` model changes), and dedupe duplicate failure warnings in outbound replies. (#16131) Thanks @Swader.
- Agents/Process/Bootstrap: preserve unbounded `process log` offset-only pagination (default tail applies only when both `offset` and `limit` are omitted) and enforce strict `bootstrapTotalMaxChars` budgeting across injected bootstrap content (including markers), skipping additional injection when remaining budget is too small. (#16539) Thanks @CharlieGreenman.
- Agents/Workspace: persist bootstrap onboarding state so partially initialized workspaces recover missing `BOOTSTRAP.md` once, while completed onboarding keeps BOOTSTRAP deleted even if runtime files are later recreated. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/Workspace: create `BOOTSTRAP.md` when core workspace files are seeded in partially initialized workspaces, while keeping BOOTSTRAP one-shot after onboarding deletion. (#16457) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: classify external timeout aborts during compaction the same as internal timeouts, preventing unnecessary auth-profile rotation and preserving compaction-timeout snapshot fallback behavior. (#9855) Thanks @mverrilli.
- Agents: treat empty-stream provider failures (`request ended without sending any chunks`) as timeout-class failover signals, enabling auth-profile rotation/fallback and showing a friendly timeout message instead of raw provider errors. (#10210) Thanks @zenchantlive.
- Agents: treat `read` tool `file_path` arguments as valid in tool-start diagnostics to avoid false “read tool called without path” warnings when alias parameters are used. (#16717) Thanks @Stache73.
- Agents/Transcript: drop malformed tool-call blocks with blank required fields (`id`/`name` or missing `input`/`arguments`) during session transcript repair to prevent persistent tool-call corruption on future turns. (#15485) Thanks @mike-zachariades.
- Tools/Write/Edit: normalize structured text-block arguments for `content`/`oldText`/`newText` before filesystem edits, preventing JSON-like file corruption and false “exact text not found” misses from block-form params. (#16778) Thanks @danielpipernz.
- Ollama/Agents: avoid forcing `<final>` tag enforcement for Ollama models, which could suppress all output as `(no output)`. (#16191) Thanks @briancolinger.
- Plugins: suppress false duplicate plugin id warnings when the same extension is discovered via multiple paths (config/workspace/global vs bundled), while still warning on genuine duplicates. (#16222) Thanks @shadril238.
- Agents/Process: supervise PTY/child process lifecycles with explicit ownership, cancellation, timeouts, and deterministic cleanup, preventing Codex/Pi PTY sessions from dying or stalling on resume. (#14257) Thanks @onutc.
- Skills: watch `SKILL.md` only when refreshing skills snapshot to avoid file-descriptor exhaustion in large data trees. (#11325) Thanks @household-bard.
- Memory/QMD: make `memory status` read-only by skipping QMD boot update/embed side effects for status-only manager checks.
- Memory/QMD: keep original QMD failures when builtin fallback initialization fails (for example missing embedding API keys), instead of replacing them with fallback init errors.
- Memory/Builtin: keep `memory status` dirty reporting stable across invocations by deriving status-only manager dirty state from persisted index metadata instead of process-start defaults. (#10863) Thanks @BarryYangi.
- Memory/QMD: cap QMD command output buffering to prevent memory exhaustion from pathological `qmd` command output.
- Memory/QMD: parse qmd scope keys once per request to avoid repeated parsing in scope checks.
- Memory/QMD: query QMD index using exact docid matches before falling back to prefix lookup for better recall correctness and index efficiency.
- Memory/QMD: pass result limits to `search`/`vsearch` commands so QMD can cap results earlier.
- Memory/QMD: avoid reading full markdown files when a `from/lines` window is requested in QMD reads.
- Memory/QMD: skip rewriting unchanged session export markdown files during sync to reduce disk churn.
- Memory/QMD: make QMD result JSON parsing resilient to noisy command output by extracting the first JSON array from noisy `stdout`.
- Memory/QMD: treat prefixed `no results found` marker output as an empty result set in qmd JSON parsing. (#11302) Thanks @blazerui.
- Memory/QMD: avoid multi-collection `query` ranking corruption by running one `qmd query -c <collection>` per managed collection and merging by best score (also used for `search`/`vsearch` fallback-to-query). (#16740) Thanks @volarian-vai.
- Memory/QMD: rebind managed collections when existing collection metadata drifts (including sessions name-only listings), preventing non-default agents from reusing another agent's `sessions` collection path. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Memory/QMD: make `openclaw memory index` verify and print the active QMD index file path/size, and fail when QMD leaves a missing or zero-byte index artifact after an update. (#16775) Thanks @Shunamxiao.
- Memory/QMD: detect null-byte `ENOTDIR` update failures, rebuild managed collections once, and retry update to self-heal corrupted collection metadata. (#12919) Thanks @jorgejhms.
- Memory/QMD/Security: add `rawKeyPrefix` support for QMD scope rules and preserve legacy `keyPrefix: "agent:..."` matching, preventing scoped deny bypass when operators match agent-prefixed session keys.
- Memory/Builtin: narrow memory watcher targets to markdown globs and ignore dependency/venv directories to reduce file-descriptor pressure during memory sync startup. (#11721) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: treat recalled memories as untrusted context (escape injected memory text + explicit non-instruction framing), skip likely prompt-injection payloads during auto-capture, and restrict auto-capture to user messages to reduce memory-poisoning risk. (#12524) Thanks @davidschmid24.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: require explicit `autoCapture: true` opt-in (default is now disabled) to prevent automatic PII capture unless operators intentionally enable it. (#12552) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Diagnostics/Memory: prune stale diagnostic session state entries and cap tracked session states to prevent unbounded in-memory growth on long-running gateways. (#5136) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.

- Skills/Memory: remove disconnected nodes from remote-skills cache to prevent stale node metadata from accumulating over long uptimes. (#6760) Thanks @coygeek.
- Sandbox/Tools: make sandbox file tools bind-mount aware (including absolute container paths) and enforce read-only bind semantics for writes. (#16379) Thanks @tasaankaeris.
- Sandbox/Prompts: show the sandbox container workdir as the prompt working directory and clarify host-path usage for file tools, preventing host-path `exec` failures in sandbox sessions. (#16790) Thanks @carrotRakko.

- Media/Security: harden local media allowlist bypasses by requiring an explicit `readFile` override when callers mark paths as validated, and reject filesystem-root `localRoots` entries. (#16739)
- Media/Security: allow outbound local media reads from the active agent workspace (including `workspace-<agentId>`) via agent-scoped local roots, avoiding broad global allowlisting of all per-agent workspaces. (#17136) Thanks @MisterGuy420.
- Outbound/Media: thread explicit `agentId` through core `sendMessage` direct-delivery path so agent-scoped local media roots apply even when mirror metadata is absent. (#17268) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Discord/Security: harden voice message media loading (SSRF + allowed-local-root checks) so tool-supplied paths/URLs cannot be used to probe internal URLs or read arbitrary local files.
- Security/BlueBubbles: require explicit `mediaLocalRoots` allowlists for local outbound media path reads to prevent local file disclosure. (#16322) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/BlueBubbles: reject ambiguous shared-path webhook routing when multiple webhook targets match the same guid/password.

- Security/Pairing: scope pairing allowlist writes/reads to channel accounts (for example `telegram:yy`), and propagate account-aware pairing approvals so multi-account channels do not share a single per-channel pairing allowFrom store. (#17631) Thanks @crazytan.
- Security/iMessage: keep DM pairing-store identities out of group allowlist authorization (prevents cross-context command authorization). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Google Chat: deprecate `users/<email>` allowlists (treat `users/...` as immutable user id only); keep raw email allowlists for usability. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Google Chat: reject ambiguous shared-path webhook routing when multiple webhook targets verify successfully (prevents cross-account policy-context misrouting). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Security: require numeric Telegram sender IDs for allowlist authorization (reject `@username` principals), auto-resolve `@username` to IDs in `openclaw doctor --fix` (when possible), and warn in `openclaw security audit` when legacy configs contain usernames. Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Security/Windows: avoid shell invocation when spawning child processes to prevent cmd.exe metacharacter injection via untrusted CLI arguments (e.g. agent prompt text).
- Telegram: set webhook callback timeout handling to `onTimeout: "return"` (10s) so long-running update processing no longer emits webhook 500s and retry storms. (#16763) Thanks @chansearrington.
- Signal: preserve case-sensitive `group:` target IDs during normalization so mixed-case group IDs no longer fail with `Group not found`. (#16748) Thanks @repfigit.

- Security/Agents: enforce workspace-root path bounds for `apply_patch` in non-sandbox mode to block traversal and symlink escape writes. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Agents: enforce symlink-escape checks for `apply_patch` delete hunks under `workspaceOnly`, while still allowing deleting the symlink itself. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Agents (macOS): prevent shell injection when writing Claude CLI keychain credentials. (#15924) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.

- Security/Exec approvals: prevent safeBins allowlist bypass via shell expansion (host exec allowlist mode only; not enabled by default). Thanks @christos-eth.
- Security/Exec: harden PATH handling by disabling project-local `node_modules/.bin` bootstrapping by default, disallowing node-host `PATH` overrides, and spawning ACP servers via the current executable by default. Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Tlon: harden Urbit URL fetching against SSRF by blocking private/internal hosts by default (opt-in: `channels.tlon.allowPrivateNetwork`). Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call (Telnyx): require webhook signature verification when receiving inbound events; configs without `telnyx.publicKey` are now rejected unless `skipSignatureVerification` is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call: require valid Twilio webhook signatures even when ngrok free tier loopback compatibility mode is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Discovery: stop treating Bonjour TXT records as authoritative routing (prefer resolved service endpoints) and prevent discovery from overriding stored TLS pins; autoconnect now requires a previously trusted gateway. Thanks @simecek.

## 2026.2.13

### Changes

- Install: add optional Podman-based setup: `setup-podman.sh` for one-time host setup (openclaw user, image, launch script, systemd quadlet), `run-openclaw-podman.sh launch` / `launch setup`; systemd Quadlet unit for openclaw user service; docs for rootless container, openclaw user (subuid/subgid), and quadlet (troubleshooting). (#16273) Thanks @DarwinsBuddy.
- Discord: send voice messages with waveform previews from local audio files (including silent delivery). (#7253) Thanks @nyanjou.
- Discord: add configurable presence status/activity/type/url (custom status defaults to activity text). (#10855) Thanks @h0tp-ftw.
- Slack/Plugins: add thread-ownership outbound gating via `message_sending` hooks, including @-mention bypass tracking and Slack outbound hook wiring for cancel/modify behavior. (#15775) Thanks @DarlingtonDeveloper.
- Agents: add synthetic catalog support for `hf:zai-org/GLM-5`. (#15867) Thanks @battman21.
- Skills: remove duplicate `local-places` Google Places skill/proxy and keep `goplaces` as the single supported Google Places path.
- Agents: add pre-prompt context diagnostics (`messages`, `systemPromptChars`, `promptChars`, provider/model, session file) before embedded runner prompt calls to improve overflow debugging. (#8930) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Onboarding/Providers: add first-class Hugging Face Inference provider support (provider wiring, onboarding auth choice/API key flow, and default-model selection), and preserve Hugging Face auth intent in auth-choice remapping (`tokenProvider=huggingface` with `authChoice=apiKey`) while skipping env-override prompts when an explicit token is provided. (#13472) Thanks @Josephrp.
- Onboarding/Providers: add `minimax-api-key-cn` auth choice for the MiniMax China API endpoint. (#15191) Thanks @liuy.

### Breaking

- Config/State: removed legacy `.moltbot` auto-detection/migration and `moltbot.json` config candidates. If you still have state/config under `~/.moltbot`, move it to `~/.openclaw` (recommended) or set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` explicitly.

### Fixes

- Gateway/Auth: add trusted-proxy mode hardening follow-ups by keeping `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_*` env compatibility, auto-normalizing invalid setup combinations in interactive `gateway configure` (trusted-proxy forces `bind=lan` and disables Tailscale serve/funnel), and suppressing shared-secret/rate-limit audit findings that do not apply to trusted-proxy deployments. (#15940) Thanks @nickytonline.
- Docs/Hooks: update hooks documentation URLs to the new `/automation/hooks` location. (#16165) Thanks @nicholascyh.
- Security/Audit: warn when `gateway.tools.allow` re-enables default-denied tools over HTTP `POST /tools/invoke`, since this can increase RCE blast radius if the gateway is reachable.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: harden npm-based installs by restricting specs to registry packages only, passing `--ignore-scripts` to `npm pack`, and cleaning up temp install directories.
- Security/Sessions: preserve inter-session input provenance for routed prompts so delegated/internal sessions are not treated as direct external user instructions. Thanks @anbecker.
- Feishu: stop persistent Typing reaction on NO_REPLY/suppressed runs by wiring reply-dispatcher cleanup to remove typing indicators. (#15464) Thanks @arosstale.
- Agents: strip leading empty lines from `sanitizeUserFacingText` output and normalize whitespace-only outputs to empty text. (#16158) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- BlueBubbles: gracefully degrade when Private API is disabled by filtering private-only actions, skipping private-only reactions/reply effects, and avoiding private reply markers so non-private flows remain usable. (#16002) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Outbound: add a write-ahead delivery queue with crash-recovery retries to prevent lost outbound messages after gateway restarts. (#15636) Thanks @nabbilkhan, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Threading: auto-inject implicit reply threading so `replyToMode` works without requiring model-emitted `[[reply_to_current]]`, while preserving `replyToMode: "off"` behavior for implicit Slack replies and keeping block-streaming chunk coalescing stable under `replyToMode: "first"`. (#14976) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Auto-reply/Threading: honor explicit `[[reply_to_*]]` tags even when `replyToMode` is `off`. (#16174) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Plugins/Threading: rename `allowTagsWhenOff` to `allowExplicitReplyTagsWhenOff` and keep the old key as a deprecated alias for compatibility. (#16189)
- Outbound/Threading: pass `replyTo` and `threadId` from `message send` tool actions through the core outbound send path to channel adapters, preserving thread/reply routing. (#14948) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Auto-reply/Media: allow image-only inbound messages (no caption) to reach the agent instead of short-circuiting as empty text, and preserve thread context in queued/followup prompt bodies for media-only runs. (#11916) Thanks @arosstale.
- Discord: route autoThread replies to existing threads instead of the root channel. (#8302) Thanks @gavinbmoore, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI: add `img` to DOMPurify allowed tags and `src`/`alt` to allowed attributes so markdown images render in webchat instead of being stripped. (#15437) Thanks @lailoo.
- Telegram/Matrix: treat MP3 and M4A (including `audio/mp4`) as voice-compatible for `asVoice` routing, and keep WAV/AAC falling back to regular audio sends. (#15438) Thanks @azade-c.
- WhatsApp: preserve outbound document filenames for web-session document sends instead of always sending `"file"`. (#15594) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Telegram: cap bot menu registration to Telegram's 100-command limit with an overflow warning while keeping typed hidden commands available. (#15844) Thanks @battman21.
- Telegram: scope skill commands to the resolved agent for default accounts so `setMyCommands` no longer triggers `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` when multiple agents are configured. (#15599)
- Discord: avoid misrouting numeric guild allowlist entries to `/channels/<guildId>` by prefixing guild-only inputs with `guild:` during resolution. (#12326) Thanks @headswim.
- Memory/QMD: default `memory.qmd.searchMode` to `search` for faster CPU-only recall and always scope `search`/`vsearch` requests to managed collections (auto-falling back to `query` when required). (#16047) Thanks @togotago.
- Memory/LanceDB: add configurable `captureMaxChars` for auto-capture while keeping the legacy 500-char default. (#16641) Thanks @ciberponk.
- MS Teams: preserve parsed mention entities/text when appending OneDrive fallback file links, and accept broader real-world Teams mention ID formats (`29:...`, `8:orgid:...`) while still rejecting placeholder patterns. (#15436) Thanks @hyojin.
- Media: classify `text/*` MIME types as documents in media-kind routing so text attachments are no longer treated as unknown. (#12237) Thanks @arosstale.
- Inbound/Web UI: preserve literal `\n` sequences when normalizing inbound text so Windows paths like `C:\\Work\\nxxx\\README.md` are not corrupted. (#11547) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- TUI/Streaming: preserve richer streamed assistant text when final payload drops pre-tool-call text blocks, while keeping non-empty final payload authoritative for plain-text updates. (#15452) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Providers/MiniMax: switch implicit MiniMax API-key provider from `openai-completions` to `anthropic-messages` with the correct Anthropic-compatible base URL, fixing `invalid role: developer (2013)` errors on MiniMax M2.5. (#15275) Thanks @lailoo.
- Ollama/Agents: use resolved model/provider base URLs for native `/api/chat` streaming (including aliased providers), normalize `/v1` endpoints, and forward abort + `maxTokens` stream options for reliable cancellation and token caps. (#11853) Thanks @BrokenFinger98.
- OpenAI Codex/Spark: implement end-to-end `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` support across fallback/thinking/model resolution and `models list` forward-compat visibility. (#14990, #15174) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y, @loiie45e.
- Agents/Codex: allow `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` in forward-compat fallback, live model filtering, and thinking presets, and fix model-picker recognition for spark. (#14990) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Models/Codex: resolve configured `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` through forward-compat fallback during `models list`, so it is not incorrectly tagged as missing when runtime resolution succeeds. (#15174) Thanks @loiie45e.
- OpenAI Codex/Auth: bridge OpenClaw OAuth profiles into `pi` `auth.json` so model discovery and models-list registry resolution can use Codex OAuth credentials. (#15184) Thanks @loiie45e.
- Auth/OpenAI Codex: share OAuth login handling across onboarding and `models auth login --provider openai-codex`, keep onboarding alive when OAuth fails, and surface a direct OAuth help note instead of terminating the wizard. (#15406, follow-up to #14552) Thanks @zhiluo20.
- Onboarding/Providers: add vLLM as an onboarding provider with model discovery, auth profile wiring, and non-interactive auth-choice validation. (#12577) Thanks @gejifeng.
- Onboarding/CLI: restore terminal state without resuming paused `stdin`, so onboarding exits cleanly (including Docker TTY installs that would otherwise hang). (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Signal/Install: auto-install `signal-cli` via Homebrew on non-x64 Linux architectures, avoiding x86_64 native binary `Exec format error` failures on arm64/arm hosts. (#15443) Thanks @jogvan-k.
- macOS Voice Wake: fix a crash in trigger trimming for CJK/Unicode transcripts by matching and slicing on original-string ranges instead of transformed-string indices. (#11052) Thanks @Flash-LHR.
- Mattermost (plugin): retry websocket monitor connections with exponential backoff and abort-aware teardown so transient connect failures no longer permanently stop monitoring. (#14962) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Discord/Agents: apply channel/group `historyLimit` during embedded-runner history compaction to prevent long-running channel sessions from bypassing truncation and overflowing context windows. (#11224) Thanks @shadril238.
- Outbound targets: fail closed for WhatsApp/Twitch/Google Chat fallback paths so invalid or missing targets are dropped instead of rerouted, and align resolver hints with strict target requirements. (#13578) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Restart: clear stale command-queue and heartbeat wake runtime state after SIGUSR1 in-process restarts to prevent zombie gateway behavior where queued work stops draining. (#15195) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: prevent scheduler silent-death races during runner reloads, preserve retry cooldown backoff under wake bursts, and prioritize user/action wake causes over interval/retry reasons when coalescing. (#15108) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: allow explicit wake (`wake`) and hook wake (`hook:*`) reasons to run even when `HEARTBEAT.md` is effectively empty so queued system events are processed. (#14527) Thanks @arosstale.
- Auto-reply/Heartbeat: strip sentence-ending `HEARTBEAT_OK` tokens even when followed by up to 4 punctuation characters, while preserving surrounding sentence punctuation. (#15847) Thanks @Spacefish.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` when resolving existing transcript paths in reply runs so non-default agents and heartbeat/chat handlers no longer fail with `Session file path must be within sessions directory`. (#15141) Thanks @Goldenmonstew.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` through status and usage transcript-resolution paths (auto-reply, gateway usage APIs, and session cost/log loaders) so non-default agents can resolve absolute session files without path-validation failures. (#15103) Thanks @jalehman.
- Sessions: archive previous transcript files on `/new` and `/reset` session resets (including gateway `sessions.reset`) so stale transcripts do not accumulate on disk. (#14869) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Status/Sessions: stop clamping derived `totalTokens` to context-window size, keep prompt-token snapshots wired through session accounting, and surface context usage as unknown when fresh snapshot data is missing to avoid false 100% reports. (#15114) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/Routing: speed up hot paths for session listing (derived titles + previews), WS broadcast, and binding resolution.
- Gateway/Sessions: cache derived title + last-message transcript reads to speed up repeated sessions list refreshes.
- CLI/Completion: route plugin-load logs to stderr and write generated completion scripts directly to stdout to avoid `source <(openclaw completion ...)` corruption. (#15481) Thanks @arosstale.
- CLI: lazily load outbound provider dependencies and remove forced success-path exits so commands terminate naturally without killing intentional long-running foreground actions. (#12906) Thanks @DrCrinkle.
- CLI: speed up startup by lazily registering core commands (keeps rich `--help` while reducing cold-start overhead).
- Security/Gateway + ACP: block high-risk tools (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) from HTTP `/tools/invoke` by default with `gateway.tools.{allow,deny}` overrides, and harden ACP permission selection to fail closed when tool identity/options are ambiguous while supporting `allow_always`/`reject_always`. (#15390) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/ACP: prompt for non-read/search permission requests in ACP clients (reduces silent tool approval risk). Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Gateway: breaking default-behavior change - canvas IP-based auth fallback now only accepts machine-scoped addresses (RFC1918, link-local, ULA IPv6, CGNAT); public-source IP matches now require bearer token auth. (#14661) Thanks @sumleo.
- Security/Link understanding: block loopback/internal host patterns and private/mapped IPv6 addresses in extracted URL handling to close SSRF bypasses in link CLI flows. (#15604) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Security/Browser: constrain `POST /trace/stop`, `POST /wait/download`, and `POST /download` output paths to OpenClaw temp roots and reject traversal/escape paths.
- Security/Browser: sanitize download `suggestedFilename` to keep implicit `wait/download` paths within the downloads root. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: confine `POST /hooks/file-chooser` upload paths to an OpenClaw temp uploads root and reject traversal/escape paths. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: require auth for the sandbox browser bridge server (protects `/profiles`, `/tabs`, CDP URLs, and other control endpoints). Thanks @jackhax.
- Security: bind local helper servers to loopback and fail closed on non-loopback OAuth callback hosts (reduces localhost/LAN attack surface).
- Security/Canvas: serve A2UI assets via the shared safe-open path (`openFileWithinRoot`) to close traversal/TOCTOU gaps, with traversal and symlink regression coverage. (#10525) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/WhatsApp: enforce `0o600` on `creds.json` and `creds.json.bak` on save/backup/restore paths to reduce credential file exposure. (#10529) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/Gateway: sanitize and truncate untrusted WebSocket header values in pre-handshake close logs to reduce log-poisoning risk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Audit: add misconfiguration checks for sandbox Docker config with sandbox mode off, ineffective `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries, global minimal tool-profile overrides by agent profiles, and permissive extension-plugin tool reachability.
- Security/Audit: distinguish external webhooks (`hooks.enabled`) from internal hooks (`hooks.internal.enabled`) in attack-surface summaries to avoid false exposure signals when only internal hooks are enabled. (#13474) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Security/Onboarding: clarify multi-user DM isolation remediation with explicit `openclaw config set session.dmScope ...` commands in security audit, doctor security, and channel onboarding guidance. (#13129) Thanks @VintLin.
- Security/Gateway: bind node `system.run` approval overrides to gateway exec-approval records (runId-bound), preventing approval-bypass via `node.invoke` param injection. Thanks @222n5.
- Agents/Nodes: harden node exec approval decision handling in the `nodes` tool run path by failing closed on unexpected approval decisions, and add regression coverage for approval-required retry/deny/timeout flows. (#4726) Thanks @rmorse.
- Android/Nodes: harden `app.update` by requiring HTTPS and gateway-host URL matching plus SHA-256 verification, stream URL camera downloads to disk with size guards to avoid memory spikes, and stop signing release builds with debug keys. (#13541) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Routing: enforce strict binding-scope matching across peer/guild/team/roles so peer-scoped Discord/Slack bindings no longer match unrelated guild/team contexts or fallback tiers. (#15274) Thanks @lailoo.
- Exec/Allowlist: allow multiline heredoc bodies (`<<`, `<<-`) while keeping multiline non-heredoc shell commands blocked, so exec approval parsing permits heredoc input safely without allowing general newline command chaining. (#13811) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Config: preserve `${VAR}` env references when writing config files so `openclaw config set/apply/patch` does not persist secrets to disk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Config: remove a cross-request env-snapshot race in config writes by carrying read-time env context into write calls per request, preserving `${VAR}` refs safely under concurrent gateway config mutations. (#11560) Thanks @akoscz.
- Config: log overwrite audit entries (path, backup target, and hash transition) whenever an existing config file is replaced, improving traceability for unexpected config clobbers.
- Config: keep legacy audio transcription migration strict by rejecting non-string/unsafe command tokens while still migrating valid custom script executables. (#5042) Thanks @shayan919293.
- Config: accept `$schema` key in config file so JSON Schema editor tooling works without validation errors. (#14998)

- Agents/Image tool: cap image-analysis completion `maxTokens` by model capability (`min(4096, model.maxTokens)`) to avoid over-limit provider failures while still preventing truncation. (#11770) Thanks @detecti1.
- Agents/Compaction: centralize exec default resolution in the shared tool factory so per-agent `tools.exec` overrides (host/security/ask/node and related defaults) persist across compaction retries. (#15833) Thanks @napetrov.
- Gateway/Agents: stop injecting a phantom `main` agent into gateway agent listings when `agents.list` explicitly excludes it. (#11450) Thanks @arosstale.
- Process/Exec: avoid shell execution for `.exe` commands on Windows so env overrides work reliably in `runCommandWithTimeout`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Daemon/Windows: preserve literal backslashes in `gateway.cmd` command parsing so drive and UNC paths are not corrupted in runtime checks and doctor entrypoint comparisons. (#15642) Thanks @arosstale.
- Sandbox: pass configured `sandbox.docker.env` variables to sandbox containers at `docker create` time. (#15138) Thanks @stevebot-alive.
- Voice Call: route webhook runtime event handling through shared manager event logic so rejected inbound hangups are idempotent in production, with regression tests for duplicate reject events and provider-call-ID remapping parity. (#15892) Thanks @dcantu96.
- Cron: add regression coverage for announce-mode isolated jobs so runs that already report `delivered: true` do not enqueue duplicate main-session relays, including delivery configs where `mode` is omitted and defaults to announce. (#15737) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Cron: honor `deleteAfterRun` in isolated announce delivery by mapping it to subagent announce cleanup mode, so cron run sessions configured for deletion are removed after completion. (#15368) Thanks @arosstale.
- Web tools/web_fetch: prefer `text/markdown` responses for Cloudflare Markdown for Agents, add `cf-markdown` extraction for markdown bodies, and redact fetched URLs in `x-markdown-tokens` debug logs to avoid leaking raw paths/query params. (#15376) Thanks @Yaxuan42.
- Tools/web_search: support `freshness` for the Perplexity provider by mapping `pd`/`pw`/`pm`/`py` to Perplexity `search_recency_filter` values and including freshness in the Perplexity cache key. (#15343) Thanks @echoVic.
- Clawdock: avoid Zsh readonly variable collisions in helper scripts. (#15501) Thanks @nkelner.
- Memory: switch default local embedding model to the QAT `embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0` variant for better quality at the same footprint. (#15429) Thanks @azade-c.
- Docs/Discord: expand quick setup and clarify guild workspace guidance. (#20088) Thanks @pejmanjohn, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Docs/Mermaid: remove hardcoded Mermaid init theme blocks from four docs diagrams so dark mode inherits readable theme defaults. (#15157) Thanks @heytulsiprasad.
- Security/Pairing: generate 256-bit base64url device and node pairing tokens and use byte-safe constant-time verification to avoid token-compare edge-case failures. (#16535) Thanks @FaizanKolega, @gumadeiras.

## 2026.2.12

### Changes

- CLI/Plugins: add `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` with `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--keep-files` options, including safe uninstall path handling and plugin uninstall docs. (#5985) Thanks @JustasMonkev.
- CLI: add `openclaw logs --local-time` to display log timestamps in local timezone. (#13818) Thanks @xialonglee.
- Telegram: render blockquotes as native `<blockquote>` tags instead of stripping them. (#14608)
- Telegram: expose `/compact` in the native command menu. (#10352) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Discord: add role-based allowlists and role-based agent routing. (#10650) Thanks @Minidoracat.
- Config: avoid redacting `maxTokens`-like fields during config snapshot redaction, preventing round-trip validation failures in `/config`. (#14006) Thanks @constansino.

### Breaking

- Hooks: `POST /hooks/agent` now rejects payload `sessionKey` overrides by default. To keep fixed hook context, set `hooks.defaultSessionKey` (recommended with `hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes: ["hook:"]`). If you need legacy behavior, explicitly set `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey: true`. Thanks @alpernae for reporting.

### Fixes

- Gateway/OpenResponses: harden URL-based `input_file`/`input_image` handling with explicit SSRF deny policy, hostname allowlists (`files.urlAllowlist` / `images.urlAllowlist`), per-request URL input caps (`maxUrlParts`), blocked-fetch audit logging, and regression coverage/docs updates.

- Security/Web tools: treat browser/web content as untrusted by default (wrapped outputs for browser snapshot/tabs/console and structured external-content metadata for web tools), and strip `toolResult.details` from model-facing transcript/compaction inputs to reduce prompt-injection replay risk.
- Security/Hooks: harden webhook and device token verification with shared constant-time secret comparison, and add per-client auth-failure throttling for hook endpoints (`429` + `Retry-After`). Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Browser: require auth for loopback browser control HTTP routes, auto-generate `gateway.auth.token` when browser control starts without auth, and add a security-audit check for unauthenticated browser control. Thanks @tcusolle.
- Sessions/Gateway: harden transcript path resolution and reject unsafe session IDs/file paths so session operations stay within agent sessions directories. Thanks @akhmittra.
- Sessions: preserve `verboseLevel`, `thinkingLevel`/`reasoningLevel`, and `ttsAuto` overrides across `/new` and `/reset` session resets. (#10787) Thanks @mcaxtr.

- Auth: read Codex CLI keychain tokens on macOS before falling back to `~/.codex/auth.json`, preventing stale refresh tokens from breaking gateway live tests.
- Security/Exec approvals: reject shell command substitution (`$()` and backticks) inside double quotes to prevent exec allowlist bypass when exec allowlist mode is explicitly enabled (the default configuration does not use this mode). Thanks @simecek.

## 2026.1.8

### Highlights

- Security: DMs locked down by default across providers; pairing-first + allowlist guidance.
- Sandbox: per-agent scope defaults + workspace access controls; tool/session isolation tuned.
- Agent loop: compaction, pruning, streaming, and error handling hardened.
- Providers: Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack reliability, threading, reactions, media, and retries improved.
- Control UI: logs tab, streaming stability, focus mode, and large-output rendering fixes.
- CLI/Gateway/Doctor: daemon/logs/status, auth migration, and diagnostics significantly expanded.

### Breaking

- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `openclaw pairing list <provider>` + `openclaw pairing approve <provider> <code>`.
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes

- **CLI/Gateway/Doctor:** daemon runtime selection + improved logs/status/health/errors; auth/password handling for local CLI; richer close/timeout details; auto-migrate legacy config/sessions/state; integrity checks + repair prompts; `--yes`/`--non-interactive`; `--deep` gateway scans; better restart/service hints.
- **Agent loop + compaction:** compaction/pruning tuning, overflow handling, safer bootstrap context, and per-provider threading/confirmations; opt-in tool-result pruning + compact tracking.
- **Sandbox + tools:** per-agent sandbox overrides, workspaceAccess controls, session tool visibility, tool policy overrides, process isolation, and tool schema/timeout/reaction unification.
- **Providers (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Signal/iMessage):** retry/backoff, threading, reactions, media groups/attachments, mention gating, typing behavior, and error/log stability; long polling + forum topic isolation for Telegram.
- **Gateway/CLI UX:** `openclaw logs`, cron list colors/aliases, docs search, agents list/add/delete flows, status usage snapshots, runtime/auth source display, and `/status`/commands auth unification.
- **Control UI/Web:** logs tab, focus mode polish, config form resilience, streaming stability, tool output caps, windowed chat history, and reconnect/password URL auth.
- **macOS/Android/TUI/Build:** macOS gateway races, QR bundling, JSON5 config safety, Voice Wake hardening; Android EXIF rotation + APK naming/versioning; TUI key handling; tooling/bundling fixes.
- **Packaging/compat:** npm dist folder coverage, Node 25 qrcode-terminal import fixes, Bun/Playwright/WebSocket patches, and Docker Bun install.
- **Docs:** new FAQ/ClawHub/config examples/showcase entries and clarified auth, sandbox, and systemd docs.

### Maintenance

- Skills additions (Himalaya email, CodexBar, 1Password).
- Dependency refreshes (pi-\* stack, Slack SDK, discord-api-types, file-type, zod, Biome, Vite).

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights

- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

- Env: load global `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.openclaw/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when OpenAI emits repeated `message_end` events.
- Commands: unify /status (inline) and command auth across providers; group bypass for authorized control commands; remove Discord /clawd slash handler.
- CLI: run `openclaw agent` via the Gateway by default; use `--local` to force embedded mode.
