Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai

## 2026.2.26 (Unreleased)

### Changes

- Agents/Routing CLI: add `openclaw agents bindings`, `openclaw agents bind`, and `openclaw agents unbind` for account-scoped route management, including channel-only to account-scoped binding upgrades, role-aware binding identity handling, plugin-resolved binding account IDs, and optional account-binding prompts in `openclaw channels add`. (#27195) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Android/Nodes: add `notifications.list` support on Android nodes and expose `nodes notifications_list` in agent tooling for listing active device notifications. (#27344) thanks @obviyus.

### Fixes

- Doctor/State integrity: ignore metadata-only slash routing sessions when checking recent missing transcripts so `openclaw doctor` no longer reports false-positive transcript-missing warnings for `*:slash:*` keys. (#27375) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Channels/Multi-account config: when adding a non-default channel account to a single-account top-level channel setup, move existing account-scoped top-level single-account values into `channels.<channel>.accounts.default` before writing the new account so the original account keeps working without duplicated account values at channel root; `openclaw doctor --fix` now repairs previously mixed channel account shapes the same way. (#27334) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Telegram/Inline buttons: allow callback-query button handling in groups (including `/models` follow-up buttons) when group policy authorizes the sender, by removing the redundant callback allowlist gate that blocked open-policy groups. (#27343) Thanks @GodsBoy.
- Daemon/macOS launchd: forward proxy env vars into supervised service environments, keep LaunchAgent `KeepAlive=true` semantics, and harden restart sequencing to `print -> bootout -> wait old pid exit -> bootstrap -> kickstart`. (#27276) thanks @frankekn.
- Android/Node invoke: remove native gateway WebSocket `Origin` header to avoid false origin rejections, unify invoke command registry/policy/error parsing paths, and keep command availability checks centralized to reduce dispatcher/advertisement drift. (#27257) Thanks @obviyus.
- CI/Windows: shard the Windows `checks-windows` test lane into two matrix jobs and honor explicit shard index overrides in `scripts/test-parallel.mjs` to reduce CI critical-path wall time. (#27234) Thanks @joshavant.
- Agents/Models config: preserve agent-level provider `apiKey` and `baseUrl` during merge-mode `models.json` updates when agent values are present. (#27293) thanks @Sid-Qin.

## 2026.2.25

### Changes

- Android/Chat: improve streaming delivery handling and markdown rendering quality in the native Android chat UI, including better GitHub-flavored markdown behavior. (#26079) Thanks @obviyus.
- Android/Startup perf: defer foreground-service startup, move WebView debugging init out of critical startup, and add startup macrobenchmark + low-noise perf CLI scripts for deterministic cold-start tracking. (#26659) Thanks @obviyus.
- UI/Chat compose: add mobile stacked layout for compose action buttons on small screens to improve send/session controls usability. (#11167) Thanks @junyiz.
- Heartbeat/Config: replace heartbeat DM toggle with `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy` (`allow` | `block`; also supported per-agent via `agents.list[].heartbeat.directPolicy`) for clearer delivery semantics.
- Onboarding/Security: clarify onboarding security notices that OpenClaw is personal-by-default (single trusted operator boundary) and shared/multi-user setups require explicit lock-down/hardening.
- Onboarding/Plugins: let channel plugins own interactive onboarding flows with optional `configureInteractive` and `configureWhenConfigured` hooks while preserving the generic fallback path. (#27191) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Branding/Docs + Apple surfaces: replace remaining `bot.molt` launchd label, bundle-id, logging subsystem, and command examples with `ai.openclaw` across docs, iOS app surfaces, helper scripts, and CLI test fixtures.
- Agents/Config: remind agents to call `config.schema` before config edits or config-field questions to avoid guessing. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Dependencies: update workspace dependency pins and lockfile (Bedrock SDK `3.998.0`, `@mariozechner/pi-*` `0.55.1`, TypeScript native preview `7.0.0-dev.20260225.1`) while keeping `@buape/carbon` pinned.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Heartbeat direct/DM delivery default is now `allow` again. To keep DM-blocked behavior from `2026.2.24`, set `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy: "block"` (or per-agent override).

### Fixes

- Docker/GCP onboarding: reduce first-build OOM risk by capping Node heap during `pnpm install`, reuse existing gateway token during `docker-setup.sh` reruns so `.env` stays aligned with config, auto-bootstrap Control UI allowed origins for non-loopback Docker binds, and add GCP docs guidance for tokenized dashboard links + pairing recovery commands. (#26253) Thanks @pandego.
- Agents/Subagents delivery: refactor subagent completion announce dispatch into an explicit queue/direct/fallback state machine, recover outbound channel-plugin resolution in cold/stale plugin-registry states across announce/message/gateway send paths, finalize cleanup bookkeeping when announce flow rejects, and treat Telegram sends without `message_id` as delivery failures (instead of false-success `"unknown"` IDs). (#26867, #25961, #26803, #25069, #26741) Thanks @SmithLabsLLC and @docaohieu2808.
- Telegram/Webhook: pre-initialize webhook bots, switch webhook processing to callback-mode JSON handling, and preserve full near-limit payload reads under delayed handlers to prevent webhook request hangs and dropped updates. (#26156)
- Slack/Session threads: prevent oversized parent-session inheritance from silently bricking new thread sessions, surface embedded context-overflow empty-result failures to users, and add configurable `session.parentForkMaxTokens` (default `100000`, `0` disables). (#26912) Thanks @markshields-tl.
- Pairing/Multi-account isolation: keep non-default account pairing allowlists and pending requests strictly account-scoped, while default account continues to use channel-scoped pairing allowlist storage.
- Cron/Message multi-account routing: honor explicit `delivery.accountId` for isolated cron delivery resolution, and when `message.send` omits `accountId`, fall back to the sending agent's bound channel account instead of defaulting to the global account. (#27015, #26975) Thanks @lbo728 and @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Message media roots: thread `agentId` through gateway `send` RPC and prefer explicit `agentId` over session/default resolution so non-default agent workspace media sends no longer fail with `LocalMediaAccessError`; added regression coverage for agent precedence and blank-agent fallback. (#23249) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Followups/Routing: when explicit origin routing fails, allow same-channel fallback dispatch (while still blocking cross-channel fallback) so followup replies do not get dropped on transient origin-adapter failures. (#26109) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Cron/Announce duplicate guard: track attempted announce/direct delivery separately from confirmed `delivered`, and suppress fallback main-session cron summaries when delivery was already attempted to avoid duplicate end-user sends in uncertain-ack paths. (#27018)
- LINE/Lifecycle: keep LINE `startAccount` pending until abort so webhook startup is no longer misread as immediate channel exit, preventing restart-loop storms on LINE provider boot. (#26528) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Discord/Gateway: capture and drain startup-time gateway `error` events before lifecycle listeners attach so early `Fatal Gateway error: 4014` closes surface as actionable intent guidance instead of uncaught gateway crashes. (#23832) Thanks @theotarr.
- Discord/Inbound text: preserve embed `title` + `description` fallback text in message and forwarded snapshot parsing so embed titles are not silently dropped from agent input. (#26946) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Slack/Inbound media fallback: deliver file-only messages even when Slack media downloads fail by adding a filename placeholder fallback, capping fallback names to the shared media-file limit, and normalizing empty filenames to `file` so attachment-only messages are not silently dropped. (#25181) Thanks @justinhuangcode.
- Telegram/Preview cleanup: keep finalized text previews when a later assistant message is media-only (for example mixed text plus voice turns) by skipping finalized preview archival at assistant-message boundaries, preventing cleanup from deleting already-visible final text messages. (#27042)
- Telegram/Markdown spoilers: keep valid `||spoiler||` pairs while leaving unmatched trailing `||` delimiters as literal text, avoiding false all-or-nothing spoiler suppression. (#26105) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Slack/Allowlist channels: match channel IDs case-insensitively during channel allowlist resolution so lowercase config keys (for example `c0abc12345`) correctly match Slack runtime IDs (`C0ABC12345`) under `groupPolicy: "allowlist"`, preventing silent channel-event drops. (#26878) Thanks @lbo728.
- Discord/Typing indicator: prevent stuck typing indicators by sealing channel typing keepalive callbacks after idle/cleanup and ensuring Discord dispatch always marks typing idle even if preview-stream cleanup fails. (#26295) Thanks @ngutman.
- Channels/Typing indicator: guard typing keepalive start callbacks after idle/cleanup close so post-close ticks cannot re-trigger stale typing indicators. (#26325) Thanks @win4r.
- Followups/Typing indicator: ensure followup turns mark dispatch idle on every exit path (including `NO_REPLY`, empty payloads, and agent errors) so typing keepalive cleanup always runs and channel typing indicators do not get stuck after queued/silent followups. (#26881) Thanks @codexGW.
- Voice-call/TTS tools: hide the `tts` tool when the message provider is `voice`, preventing voice-call runs from selecting self-playback TTS and falling into silent no-output loops. (#27025)
- Agents/Tools: normalize non-standard plugin tool results that omit `content` so embedded runs no longer crash with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` after tool completion (including `tesseramemo_query`). (#27007)
- Cron/Model overrides: when isolated `payload.model` is no longer allowlisted, fall back to default model selection instead of failing the job, while still returning explicit errors for invalid model strings. (#26717) Thanks @Youyou972.
- Agents/Model fallback: keep explicit text + image fallback chains reachable even when `agents.defaults.models` allowlists are present, prefer explicit run `agentId` over session-key parsing for followup fallback override resolution (with session-key fallback), treat agent-level fallback overrides as configured in embedded runner preflight, and classify `model_cooldown` / `cooling down` errors as `rate_limit` so failover continues. (#11972, #24137, #17231)
- Agents/Model fallback: keep same-provider fallback chains active when session model differs from configured primary, infer cooldown reason from provider profile state (instead of `disabledReason` only), keep no-profile fallback providers eligible (env/models.json paths), and only relax same-provider cooldown fallback attempts for `rate_limit`. (#23816) thanks @ramezgaberiel.
- Agents/Model fallback: continue fallback traversal on unrecognized errors when candidates remain, while still throwing the original unknown error on the last candidate. (#26106) Thanks @Sid-Qin.
- Models/Auth probes: map permanent auth failover reasons (`auth_permanent`, for example revoked keys) into probe auth status instead of `unknown`, so `openclaw models status --probe` reports actionable auth failures. (#25754) thanks @rrenamed.
- Hooks/Inbound metadata: include `guildId` and `channelName` in `message_received` metadata for both plugin and internal hook paths. (#26115) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Discord/Component auth: evaluate guild component interactions with command-gating authorizers so unauthorized users no longer get `CommandAuthorized: true` on modal/button events. (#26119) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Gateway auth: require pairing for operator device-identity sessions authenticated with shared token auth so unpaired devices cannot self-assign operator scopes. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway WebSocket auth: enforce origin checks for direct browser WebSocket clients beyond Control UI/Webchat, apply password-auth failure throttling to browser-origin loopback attempts (including localhost), and block silent auto-pairing for non-Control-UI browser clients to prevent cross-origin brute-force and session takeover chains. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @luz-oasis for reporting.
- Security/Gateway trusted proxy: require `operator` role for the Control UI trusted-proxy pairing bypass so unpaired `node` sessions can no longer connect via `client.id=control-ui` and invoke node event methods. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/macOS beta onboarding: remove Anthropic OAuth sign-in and the legacy `oauth.json` onboarding path that exposed the PKCE verifier via OAuth `state`; this impacted the macOS beta onboarding path only. Anthropic subscription auth is now setup-token-only and will ship in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @zdi-disclosures for reporting.
- Security/Microsoft Teams file consent: bind `fileConsent/invoke` upload acceptance/decline to the originating conversation before consuming pending uploads, preventing cross-conversation pending-file upload or cancellation via leaked `uploadId` values; includes regression coverage for match/mismatch invoke handling. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: harden `agents.files` path handling to block out-of-workspace symlink targets for `agents.files.get`/`agents.files.set`, keep in-workspace symlink targets supported, and add gateway regression coverage for both blocked escapes and allowed in-workspace symlinks. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Workspace FS: reject hardlinked workspace file aliases in `tools.fs.workspaceOnly` and `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` boundary checks (including sandbox mount-root guards) to prevent out-of-workspace read/write via in-workspace hardlink paths. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser temp paths: harden trace/download output-path handling against symlink-root and symlink-parent escapes with realpath-based write-path checks plus secure fallback tmp-dir validation that fails closed on unsafe fallback links. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Browser uploads: revalidate upload paths at use-time in Playwright file-chooser and direct-input flows so missing/rebound paths are rejected before `setFiles`, with regression coverage for strict missing-path handling.
- Security/Exec approvals: bind `system.run` approval matching to exact argv identity and preserve argv whitespace in rendered command text, preventing trailing-space executable path swaps from reusing a mismatched approval. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: harden approval-bound `system.run` execution on node hosts by rejecting symlink `cwd` paths and canonicalizing path-like executable argv before spawn, blocking mutable-cwd symlink retarget chains between approval and execution. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Signal: enforce DM/group authorization before reaction-only notification enqueue so unauthorized senders can no longer inject Signal reaction system events under `dmPolicy`/`groupPolicy`; reaction notifications now require channel access checks first. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Discord reactions: enforce DM policy/allowlist authorization before reaction-event system enqueue in direct messages; Discord reaction handling now also honors DM/group-DM enablement and guild `groupPolicy` channel gating to keep reaction ingress aligned with normal message preflight. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Slack reactions + pins: gate `reaction_*` and `pin_*` system-event enqueue through shared sender authorization so DM `dmPolicy`/`allowFrom` and channel `users` allowlists are enforced consistently for non-message ingress, with regression coverage for denied/allowed sender paths. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Telegram reactions: enforce `dmPolicy`/`allowFrom` and group allowlist authorization on `message_reaction` events before enqueueing reaction system events, preventing unauthorized reaction-triggered input in DMs and groups; ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Telegram group allowlist: fail closed for group sender authorization by removing DM pairing-store fallback from group allowlist evaluation; group sender access now requires explicit `groupAllowFrom` or per-group/per-topic `allowFrom`. (#25988) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Slack interactions: enforce channel/DM authorization and modal actor binding (`private_metadata.userId`) before enqueueing `block_action`/`view_submission`/`view_closed` system events, with regression coverage for unauthorized senders and missing/mismatched actor metadata. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: drop replayed signed webhook events with persistent per-account replay dedupe across restarts, and reject unexpected webhook backend origins when account base URL is configured. Thanks @aristorechina for reporting.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: reject unsigned webhook traffic before full body reads, reducing unauthenticated request-body exposure, with auth-order regression coverage. (#26118) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Nextcloud Talk: stop treating DM pairing-store entries as group allowlist senders, so group authorization remains bounded to configured group allowlists. (#26116) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/LINE: cap unsigned webhook body reads before auth/signature handling to bound unauthenticated body processing. (#26095) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/IRC: keep pairing-store approvals DM-only and out of IRC group allowlist authorization, with policy regression tests for allowlist resolution. (#26112) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Microsoft Teams: isolate group allowlist and command authorization from DM pairing-store entries to prevent cross-context authorization bleed. (#26111) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/SSRF guard: classify IPv6 multicast literals (`ff00::/8`) as blocked/private-internal targets in shared SSRF IP checks, preventing multicast literals from bypassing URL-host preflight and DNS answer validation. This ships in the next npm release (`2026.2.25`). Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Tests/Low-memory stability: disable Vitest `vmForks` by default on low-memory local hosts (`<64 GiB`), keep low-profile extension lane parallelism at 4 workers, and align cron isolated-agent tests with `setSessionRuntimeModel` usage to avoid deterministic suite failures. (#26324) Thanks @ngutman.

## 2026.2.24

### Changes

- Auto-reply/Abort shortcuts: expand standalone stop phrases (`stop openclaw`, `stop action`, `stop run`, `stop agent`, `please stop`, and related variants), accept trailing punctuation (for example `STOP OPENCLAW!!!`), add multilingual stop keywords (including ES/FR/ZH/HI/AR/JP/DE/PT/RU forms), and treat exact `do not do that` as a stop trigger while preserving strict standalone matching. (#25103) Thanks @steipete and @vincentkoc.
- Android/App UX: ship a native four-step onboarding flow, move post-onboarding into a five-tab shell (Connect, Chat, Voice, Screen, Settings), add a full Connect setup/manual mode screen, and refresh Android chat/settings surfaces for the new navigation model.
- Talk/Gateway config: add provider-agnostic Talk configuration with legacy compatibility, and expose gateway Talk ElevenLabs config metadata for setup/status surfaces.
- Security/Audit: add `security.trust_model.multi_user_heuristic` to flag likely shared-user ingress and clarify the personal-assistant trust model, with hardening guidance for intentional multi-user setups (`sandbox.mode="all"`, workspace-scoped FS, reduced tool surface, no personal/private identities on shared runtimes).
- Dependencies: refresh key runtime and tooling packages across the workspace (Bedrock SDK, pi runtime stack, OpenAI, Google auth, and oxlint/oxfmt), while intentionally keeping `@buape/carbon` pinned.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Heartbeat delivery now blocks direct/DM targets when destination parsing identifies a direct chat (for example `user:<id>`, Telegram user chat IDs, or WhatsApp direct numbers/JIDs). Heartbeat runs still execute, but direct-message delivery is skipped and only non-DM destinations (for example channel/group targets) can receive outbound heartbeat messages.
- **BREAKING:** Security/Sandbox: block Docker `network: "container:<id>"` namespace-join mode by default for sandbox and sandbox-browser containers. To keep that behavior intentionally, set `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.dangerouslyAllowContainerNamespaceJoin: true` (break-glass). Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.

### Fixes

- Routing/Session isolation: harden followup routing so explicit cross-channel origin replies never fall back to the active dispatcher on route failure, preserve queued overflow summary routing metadata (`channel`/`to`/`thread`) across followup drain, and prefer originating channel context over internal provider tags for embedded followup runs. This prevents webchat/control-ui context from hijacking Discord-targeted replies in shared sessions. (#25864) Thanks @Gamedesigner.
- Security/Routing: fail closed for shared-session cross-channel replies by binding outbound target resolution to the current turn’s source channel metadata (instead of stale session route fallbacks), and wire those turn-source fields through gateway + command delivery planners with regression coverage. (#24571) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Heartbeat routing: prevent heartbeat leakage/spam into Discord and other direct-message destinations by blocking direct-chat heartbeat delivery targets and keeping blocked-delivery cron/exec prompts internal-only. (#25871)
- Heartbeat defaults/prompts: switch the implicit heartbeat delivery target from `last` to `none` (opt-in for external delivery), and use internal-only cron/exec heartbeat prompt wording when delivery is disabled so background checks do not nudge user-facing relay behavior. (#25871, #24638, #25851)
- Auto-reply/Heartbeat queueing: drop heartbeat runs when a session already has an active run instead of enqueueing a stale followup, preventing duplicate heartbeat response branches after queue drain. (#25610, #25606) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Cron/Heartbeat delivery: stop inheriting cached session `lastThreadId` for heartbeat-mode target resolution unless a thread/topic is explicitly requested, so announce-mode cron and heartbeat deliveries stay on top-level destinations instead of leaking into active conversation threads. (#25730) Thanks @markshields-tl.
- Messaging tool dedupe: treat originating channel metadata as authoritative for same-target `message.send` suppression in proactive runs (heartbeat/cron/exec-event), including synthetic-provider contexts, so `delivery-mirror` transcript entries no longer cause duplicate Telegram sends. (#25835) Thanks @jadeathena84-arch.
- Channels/Typing keepalive: refresh channel typing callbacks on a keepalive interval during long replies and clear keepalive timers on idle/cleanup across core + extension dispatcher callsites so typing indicators do not expire mid-inference. (#25886, #25882) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Agents/Model fallback: when a run is currently on a configured fallback model, keep traversing the configured fallback chain instead of collapsing straight to primary-only, preventing dead-end failures when primary stays in cooldown. (#25922, #25912) Thanks @Taskle.
- Gateway/Models: honor explicit `agents.defaults.models` allowlist refs even when bundled model catalog data is stale, synthesize missing allowlist entries in `models.list`, and allow `sessions.patch`/`/model` selection for those refs without false `model not allowed` errors. (#20291) Thanks @kensipe, @nikolasdehor, and @vincentkoc.
- Control UI/Agents: inherit `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` in the Overview fallback input when no per-agent model entry exists, while preserving explicit per-agent fallback overrides (including empty lists). (#25729, #25710) Thanks @Suko.
- Automation/Subagent/Cron reliability: honor `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` in `sessions_spawn` completion/direct announce flows (no user-visible token leaks), add transient direct-announce retries for channel unavailability (for example WhatsApp listener reconnect windows), and include `cron` in the `coding` tool profile so `/tools/invoke` can execute cron actions when explicitly allowed by gateway policy. (#25800, #25656, #25842, #25813, #25822, #25821) Thanks @astra-fer, @aaajiao, @dwight11232-coder, @kevinWangSheng, @widingmarcus-cyber, and @stakeswky.
- Discord/Voice reliability: restore runtime DAVE dependency (`@snazzah/davey`), add configurable DAVE join options (`channels.discord.voice.daveEncryption` and `channels.discord.voice.decryptionFailureTolerance`), clean up voice listeners/session teardown, guard against stale connection events, and trigger controlled rejoin recovery after repeated decrypt failures to improve inbound STT stability under DAVE receive errors. (#25861, #25372, #24883, #24825, #23890, #23105, #22961, #23421, #23278, #23032)
- Discord/Block streaming: restore block-streamed reply delivery by suppressing only reasoning payloads (instead of all `block` payloads), fixing missing Discord replies in `channels.discord.streaming=block` mode. (#25839, #25836, #25792) Thanks @pewallin.
- Discord/Proxy + reactions + model picker: thread channel proxy fetch into inbound media/sticker downloads, use proxy-aware gateway metadata fetch for WSL/corporate proxy setups, wire `messages.statusReactions.{emojis,timing}` into Discord reaction lifecycle control, and compact model-picker `custom_id` keys to stay under Discord's 100-char limit while keeping backward-compatible parsing. (#25232, #25507, #25564, #25695) Thanks @openperf, @chilu18, @Yipsh, @lbo728, and @s1korrrr.
- WhatsApp/Web reconnect: treat close status `440` as non-retryable (including string-form status values), stop reconnect loops immediately, and emit operator guidance to relink after resolving session conflicts. (#25858) Thanks @markmusson.
- WhatsApp/Reasoning safety: suppress outbound payloads marked as reasoning and hard-drop text payloads that begin with `Reasoning:` before WhatsApp delivery, preventing hidden thinking blocks from leaking to end users through final-message paths. (#25804, #25214, #24328)
- Matrix/Read receipts: send read receipts as soon as Matrix messages arrive (before handler pipeline work), so clients no longer show long-lived unread/sent states while replies are processing. (#25841, #25840) Thanks @joshjhall.
- Telegram/Replies: when markdown formatting renders to empty HTML (for example syntax-only chunks in threaded replies), retry delivery with plain text, and fail loud when both formatted and plain payloads are empty to avoid false delivered states. (#25096, #25091) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Media fetch: prioritize IPv4 before IPv6 in SSRF pinned DNS address ordering so media downloads still work on hosts with broken IPv6 routing. (#24295, #23975) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Outbound API: replace Node 22's global undici dispatcher when applying Telegram `autoSelectFamily` decisions so outbound `fetch` calls inherit IPv4 fallback instead of staying pinned to stale dispatcher settings. (#25682, #25676) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Onboarding/Telegram: keep core-channel onboarding available when plugin registry population is missing by falling back to built-in adapters and continuing wizard setup with actionable recovery guidance. (#25803) Thanks @Suko.
- Android/Gateway auth: preserve Android gateway auth state across onboarding, use the native client id for operator sessions, retry with shared-token fallback after device-token auth failures, and avoid clearing tokens on transient connect errors.
- Slack/DM routing: treat `D*` channel IDs as direct messages even when Slack sends an incorrect `channel_type`, preventing DM traffic from being misclassified as channel/group chats. (#25479) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Zalo/Group policy: enforce sender authorization for group messages with `groupPolicy` + `groupAllowFrom` (fallback to `allowFrom`), default runtime group behavior to fail-closed allowlist, and block unauthorized non-command group messages before dispatch. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- macOS/Voice input: guard all audio-input startup paths against missing default microphones (Voice Wake, Talk Mode, Push-to-Talk, mic-level monitor, tester) to avoid launch/runtime crashes on mic-less Macs and fail gracefully until input becomes available. (#25817) Thanks @sfo2001.
- macOS/IME input: when marked text is active, treat Return as IME candidate confirmation first in both the voice overlay composer and shared chat composer to prevent accidental sends while composing CJK text. (#25178) Thanks @bottotl.
- macOS/Voice wake routing: default forwarded voice-wake transcripts to the `webchat` channel (instead of ambiguous `last` routing) so local voice prompts stay pinned to the control chat surface unless explicitly overridden. (#25440) Thanks @chilu18.
- macOS/Gateway launch: prefer an available `openclaw` binary before pnpm/node runtime fallback when resolving local gateway commands, so local startup no longer fails on hosts with broken runtime discovery. (#25512) Thanks @chilu18.
- macOS/Menu bar: stop reusing the injector delegate for the "Usage cost (30 days)" submenu to prevent recursive submenu injection loops when opening cost history. (#25341) Thanks @yingchunbai.
- macOS/WebChat panel: fix rounded-corner clipping by using panel-specific visual-effect blending and matching corner masking on both effect and hosting layers. (#22458) Thanks @apethree and @agisilaos.
- Windows/Exec shell selection: prefer PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) discovery (Program Files, ProgramW6432, PATH) before falling back to Windows PowerShell 5.1, fixing `&&` command chaining failures on Windows hosts with PS7 installed. (#25684, #25638) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Windows/Media safety checks: align async local-file identity validation with sync-safe-open behavior by treating win32 `dev=0` stats as unknown-device fallbacks (while keeping strict dev checks when both sides are non-zero), fixing false `Local media path is not safe to read` drops for local attachments/TTS/images. (#25708, #21989, #25699, #25878) Thanks @kevinWangSheng.
- iMessage/Reasoning safety: harden iMessage echo suppression with outbound `messageId` matching (plus scoped text fallback), and enforce reasoning-payload suppression on routed outbound delivery paths to prevent hidden thinking text from being sent as user-visible channel messages. (#25897, #1649, #25757) Thanks @rmarr and @Iranb.
- Providers/OpenRouter/Auth profiles: bypass auth-profile cooldown/disable windows for OpenRouter, so provider failures no longer put OpenRouter profiles into local cooldown and stale legacy cooldown markers are ignored in fallback and status selection paths. (#25892) Thanks @alexanderatallah for raising this and @vincentkoc for the fix.
- Providers/Google reasoning: sanitize invalid negative `thinkingBudget` payloads for Gemini 3.1 requests by dropping `-1` budgets and mapping configured reasoning effort to `thinkingLevel`, preventing malformed reasoning payloads on `google-generative-ai`. (#25900)
- Providers/SiliconFlow: normalize `thinking="off"` to `thinking: null` for `Pro/*` model payloads to avoid provider-side 400 loops and misleading compaction retries. (#25435) Thanks @Zjianru.
- Models/Bedrock auth: normalize additional Bedrock provider aliases (`bedrock`, `aws-bedrock`, `aws_bedrock`, `amazon bedrock`) to canonical `amazon-bedrock`, ensuring auth-mode resolution consistently selects AWS SDK fallback. (#25756) Thanks @fwhite13.
- Models/Providers: preserve explicit user `reasoning` overrides when merging provider model config with built-in catalog metadata, so `reasoning: false` is no longer overwritten by catalog defaults. (#25314) Thanks @lbo728.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy authenticated Control UI websocket sessions to skip device pairing when device identity is absent, preventing false `pairing required` failures behind trusted reverse proxies. (#25428) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- CLI/Memory search: accept `--query <text>` for `openclaw memory search` (while keeping positional query support), and emit a clear error when neither form is provided. (#25904, #25857) Thanks @niceysam and @stakeswky.
- CLI/Doctor: correct stale recovery hints to use valid commands (`openclaw gateway status --deep` and `openclaw configure --section model`). (#24485) Thanks @chilu18.
- Doctor/Sandbox: when sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, surface a clear actionable warning (including failure impact and remediation) instead of a mild “skip checks” note. (#25438) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Doctor/Plugins: auto-enable now resolves third-party channel plugins by manifest plugin id (not channel id), preventing invalid `plugins.entries.<channelId>` writes when ids differ. (#25275) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Config/Plugins: treat stale removed `google-antigravity-auth` plugin references as compatibility warnings (not hard validation errors) across `plugins.entries`, `plugins.allow`, `plugins.deny`, and `plugins.slots.memory`, so startup no longer fails after antigravity removal. (#25538, #25862) Thanks @chilu18.
- Config/Meta: accept numeric `meta.lastTouchedAt` timestamps and coerce them to ISO strings, preserving compatibility with agent edits that write `Date.now()` values. (#25491) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Usage accounting: parse Moonshot/Kimi `cached_tokens` fields (including `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) into normalized cache-read usage metrics. (#25436) Thanks @Elarwei001.
- Agents/Tool dispatch: await block-reply flush before tool execution starts so buffered block replies preserve message ordering around tool calls. (#25427) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Agents/Billing classification: prevent long assistant/user-facing text from being rewritten as billing failures while preserving explicit `status/code/http 402` detection for oversized structured error payloads. (#25680, #25661) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Sessions/Tool-result guard: avoid generating synthetic `toolResult` entries for assistant turns that ended with `stopReason: "aborted"` or `"error"`, preventing orphaned tool-use IDs from triggering downstream API validation errors. (#25429) Thanks @mikaeldiakhate-cell.
- Auto-reply/Reset hooks: guarantee native `/new` and `/reset` flows emit command/reset hooks even on early-return command paths, with dedupe protection to avoid double hook emission. (#25459) Thanks @chilu18.
- Hooks/Slug generator: resolve session slug model from the agent’s effective model (including defaults/fallback resolution) instead of raw agent-primary config only. (#25485) Thanks @SudeepMalipeddi.
- Sandbox/FS bridge tests: add regression coverage for dash-leading basenames to confirm sandbox file reads resolve to absolute container paths (and avoid shell-option misdiagnosis for dashed filenames). (#25891) Thanks @albertlieyingadrian.
- Sandbox/FS bridge: build canonical-path shell scripts with newline separators (not `; ` joins) to avoid POSIX `sh` `do;` syntax errors that broke sandbox file/image read-write operations. (#25737, #25824, #25868) Thanks @DennisGoldfinger and @peteragility.
- Sandbox/Config: preserve `dangerouslyAllowReservedContainerTargets` and `dangerouslyAllowExternalBindSources` during sandbox docker config resolution so explicit bind-mount break-glass overrides reach runtime validation. (#25410) Thanks @skyer-jian.
- Gateway/Security: enforce gateway auth for the exact `/api/channels` plugin root path (plus `/api/channels/` descendants), with regression coverage for query/trailing-slash variants and near-miss paths that must remain plugin-owned. (#25753) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Exec approvals: treat bare allowlist `*` as a true wildcard for parsed executables, including unresolved PATH lookups, so global opt-in allowlists work as configured. (#25250) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- iOS/Signing: improve `scripts/ios-team-id.sh` for Xcode 16+ by falling back to Xcode-managed provisioning profiles, add actionable guidance when an Apple account exists but no Team ID can be resolved, and ignore Xcode `xcodebuild` output directories (`apps/ios/build`, `apps/shared/OpenClawKit/build`, `Swabble/build`). (#22773) Thanks @brianleach.
- Control UI/Chat images: route image-click opens through a shared safe-open helper (allowing only safe URL schemes) and open new tabs with opener isolation to block tabnabbing. (#18685, #25444, #25847) Thanks @Mariana-Codebase and @shakkernerd.
- Security/Exec: sanitize inherited host execution environment before merge, canonicalize inherited PATH handling, and strip dangerous keys (`LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, and related injection vectors) from non-sandboxed exec runs. (#25755) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Hooks: normalize hook session-key classification with trim/lowercase plus Unicode NFKC folding (for example full-width `ＨＯＯＫ：...`) so external-content wrapping cannot be bypassed by mixed-case or lookalike prefixes. (#25750) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Voice Call: add Telnyx webhook replay detection and canonicalize replay-key signature encoding (Base64/Base64URL equivalent forms dedupe together), so duplicate signed webhook deliveries no longer re-trigger side effects. (#25832) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Sandbox media: restrict sandbox media tmp-path allowances to OpenClaw-managed tmp roots instead of broad host `os.tmpdir()` trust, and add outbound/channel guardrails (tmp-path lint + media-root smoke tests) to prevent regressions in local media attachment reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox media: reject hard-linked OpenClaw tmp media aliases (including symlink-to-hardlink chains) during sandbox media path resolution to prevent out-of-sandbox inode alias reads. (#25820) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Message actions: enforce local media root checks for `sendAttachment` and `setGroupIcon` when `sandboxRoot` is unset, preventing attachment hydration from reading arbitrary host files via local absolute paths. Thanks @GCXWLP for reporting.
- Security/Telegram: enforce DM authorization before media download/write (including media groups) and move telegram inbound activity tracking after DM authorization, preventing unauthorized sender-triggered inbound media disk writes. Thanks @v8hid for reporting.
- Security/Workspace FS: normalize `@`-prefixed paths before workspace-boundary checks (including workspace-only read/write/edit and sandbox mount path guards), preventing absolute-path escape attempts from bypassing guard validation. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Synology Chat: enforce fail-closed allowlist behavior for DM ingress so `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` with empty `allowedUserIds` rejects all senders instead of allowing unauthorized dispatch. (#25827) Thanks @bmendonca3 for the contribution and @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Native images: enforce `tools.fs.workspaceOnly` for native prompt image auto-load (including history refs), preventing out-of-workspace sandbox mounts from being implicitly ingested as vision input. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: bind `system.run` command display/approval text to full argv when shell-wrapper inline payloads carry positional argv values, and reject payload-only `rawCommand` mismatches for those wrapper-carrier forms, preventing hidden command execution under misleading approval text. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec companion host: forward canonical `system.run` display text (not payload-only shell snippets) to the macOS exec host, and enforce rawCommand/argv consistency there for shell-wrapper positional-argv carriers and env-modifier preludes, preventing companion-side approval/display drift. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: fail closed when transparent dispatch-wrapper unwrapping exceeds the depth cap, so nested `/usr/bin/env` chains cannot bypass shell-wrapper approval gating in `allowlist` + `ask=on-miss` mode. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec: limit default safe-bin trusted directories to immutable system paths (`/bin`, `/usr/bin`) and require explicit opt-in (`tools.exec.safeBinTrustedDirs`) for package-manager/user bin paths (for example Homebrew), add security-audit findings for risky trusted-dir choices, warn at runtime when explicitly trusted dirs are group/world writable, and add doctor hints when configured `safeBins` resolve outside trusted dirs. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Telegram/Media fetch: prioritize IPv4 before IPv6 in SSRF pinned DNS address ordering so media downloads still work on hosts with broken IPv6 routing. (#24295, #23975) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Outbound API: replace Node 22's global undici dispatcher when applying Telegram `autoSelectFamily` decisions so outbound `fetch` calls inherit IPv4 fallback instead of staying pinned to stale dispatcher settings. (#25682, #25676) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Agents/Billing classification: prevent long assistant/user-facing text from being rewritten as billing failures while preserving explicit `status/code/http 402` detection for oversized structured error payloads. (#25680, #25661) Thanks @lairtonlelis.
- Telegram/Replies: when markdown formatting renders to empty HTML (for example syntax-only chunks in threaded replies), retry delivery with plain text, and fail loud when both formatted and plain payloads are empty to avoid false delivered states. (#25096, #25091) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Sessions/Tool-result guard: avoid generating synthetic `toolResult` entries for assistant turns that ended with `stopReason: "aborted"` or `"error"`, preventing orphaned tool-use IDs from triggering downstream API validation errors. (#25429) Thanks @mikaeldiakhate-cell.
- Gateway/Sessions: preserve `modelProvider` on `sessions.reset` and avoid incorrect provider prefixes for legacy session models. (#25874) Thanks @lbo728.
- Usage accounting: parse Moonshot/Kimi `cached_tokens` fields (including `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) into normalized cache-read usage metrics. (#25436) Thanks @Elarwei001.
- Doctor/Sandbox: when sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, surface a clear actionable warning (including failure impact and remediation) instead of a mild “skip checks” note. (#25438) Thanks @mcaxtr.

- Hooks/Slug generator: resolve session slug model from the agent’s effective model (including defaults/fallback resolution) instead of raw agent-primary config only. (#25485) Thanks @SudeepMalipeddi.
- Slack/DM routing: treat `D*` channel IDs as direct messages even when Slack sends an incorrect `channel_type`, preventing DM traffic from being misclassified as channel/group chats. (#25479) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Models/Providers: preserve explicit user `reasoning` overrides when merging provider model config with built-in catalog metadata, so `reasoning: false` is no longer overwritten by catalog defaults. (#25314) Thanks @lbo728.
- Exec approvals: treat bare allowlist `*` as a true wildcard for parsed executables, including unresolved PATH lookups, so global opt-in allowlists work as configured. (#25250) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy authenticated Control UI websocket sessions to skip device pairing when device identity is absent, preventing false `pairing required` failures behind trusted reverse proxies. (#25428) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.

(#22773) Thanks @brianleach.
- macOS/Menu bar: stop reusing the injector delegate for the "Usage cost (30 days)" submenu to prevent recursive submenu injection loops when opening cost history. (#25341) Thanks @yingchunbai.
- Control UI/Chat images: route image-click opens through a shared safe-open helper (allowing only safe URL schemes) and open new tabs with opener isolation to block tabnabbing. (#18685, #25444, #25847) Thanks @Mariana-Codebase and @shakkernerd.
- CLI/Doctor: correct stale recovery hints to use valid commands (`openclaw gateway status --deep` and `openclaw configure --section model`). (#24485) Thanks @chilu18.
- CLI/Memory search: accept `--query <text>` for `openclaw memory search` (while keeping positional query support), and emit a clear error when neither form is provided. (#25904, #25857) Thanks @niceysam and @stakeswky.
- Security/Sandbox: canonicalize bind-mount source paths via existing-ancestor realpath so symlink-parent + non-existent-leaf paths cannot bypass allowed-source-roots or blocked-path checks. Thanks @tdjackey.

## 2026.2.23

### Changes

- Providers/Kilo Gateway: add first-class `kilocode` provider support (auth, onboarding, implicit provider detection, model defaults, transcript/cache-ttl handling, and docs), with default model `kilocode/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`. (#20212) Thanks @jrf0110 and @markijbema.
- Providers/Vercel AI Gateway: accept Claude shorthand model refs (`vercel-ai-gateway/claude-*`) by normalizing to canonical Anthropic-routed model ids. (#23985) Thanks @sallyom, @markbooch, and @vincentkoc.
- Docs/Prompt caching: add a dedicated prompt-caching reference covering `cacheRetention`, per-agent `params` merge precedence, Bedrock/OpenRouter behavior, and cache-ttl + heartbeat tuning. Thanks @svenssonaxel.
- Gateway/HTTP security headers: add optional `gateway.http.securityHeaders.strictTransportSecurity` support to emit `Strict-Transport-Security` for direct HTTPS deployments, with runtime wiring, validation, tests, and hardening docs.
- Sessions/Cron: harden session maintenance with `openclaw sessions cleanup`, per-agent store targeting, disk-budget controls (`session.maintenance.maxDiskBytes` / `highWaterBytes`), and safer transcript/archive cleanup + run-log retention behavior. (#24753) thanks @gumadeiras.
- Tools/web_search: add `provider: "kimi"` (Moonshot) support with key/config schema wiring and a corrected two-step `$web_search` tool flow that echoes tool results before final synthesis, including citation extraction from search results. (#16616, #18822) Thanks @adshine.
- Media understanding/Video: add a native Moonshot video provider and include Moonshot in auto video key detection, plus refactor video execution to honor `entry/config/provider` baseUrl+header precedence (matching audio behavior). (#12063) Thanks @xiaoyaner0201.
- Agents/Config: support per-agent `params` overrides merged on top of model defaults (including `cacheRetention`) so mixed-traffic agents can tune cache behavior independently. (#17470, #17112) Thanks @rrenamed.
- Agents/Bootstrap: cache bootstrap file snapshots per session key and clear them on session reset/delete, reducing prompt-cache invalidations from in-session `AGENTS.md`/`MEMORY.md` writes. (#22220) Thanks @anisoptera.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** browser SSRF policy now defaults to trusted-network mode (`browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork=true` when unset), and canonical config uses `browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork` instead of `browser.ssrfPolicy.allowPrivateNetwork`. `openclaw doctor --fix` migrates the legacy key automatically.

### Fixes

- Security/Config: redact sensitive-looking dynamic catchall keys in `config.get` snapshots (for example `env.*` and `skills.entries.*.env.*`) and preserve round-trip restore behavior for those redacted sentinels. Thanks @merc1305.
- Tests/Vitest: tier local parallel worker defaults by host memory, keep gateway serial by default on non-high-memory hosts, and document a low-profile fallback command for memory-constrained land/gate runs to prevent local OOMs. (#24719) Thanks @ngutman.
- WhatsApp/Group policy: fix `groupAllowFrom` sender filtering when `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` is set without explicit `groups` — previously all group messages were blocked even for allowlisted senders. (#24670)
- Agents/Context pruning: extend `cache-ttl` eligibility to Moonshot/Kimi and ZAI/GLM providers (including OpenRouter model refs), so `contextPruning.mode: "cache-ttl"` is no longer silently skipped for those sessions. (#24497) Thanks @lailoo.
- Doctor/Memory: query gateway-side default-agent memory embedding readiness during `openclaw doctor` (instead of inferring from generic gateway health), and warn when the gateway memory probe is unavailable or not ready while keeping `openclaw configure` remediation guidance. (#22327) thanks @therk.
- Sessions/Store: canonicalize inbound mixed-case session keys for metadata and route updates, and migrate legacy case-variant entries to a single lowercase key to prevent duplicate sessions and missing TUI/WebUI history. (#9561) Thanks @hillghost86.
- Telegram/Reactions: soft-fail reaction action errors (policy/token/emoji/API), accept snake_case `message_id`, and fallback to inbound message-id context when explicit `messageId` is omitted so DM reactions stay stable without regeneration loops. (#20236, #21001) Thanks @PeterShanxin and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Polling: scope persisted polling offsets to bot identity and reuse a single awaited runner-stop path on abort/retry, preventing cross-token offset bleed and overlapping pollers during restart/error recovery. (#10850, #11347) Thanks @talhaorak, @anooprdawar, and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Reasoning: when `/reasoning off` is active, suppress reasoning-only delivery segments and block raw fallback resend of suppressed `Reasoning:`/`<think>` text, preventing internal reasoning leakage in legacy sessions while preserving answer delivery. (#24626, #24518)
- Agents/Reasoning: when model-default thinking is active (for example `thinking=low`), keep auto-reasoning disabled unless explicitly enabled, preventing `Reasoning:` thinking-block leakage in channel replies. (#24335, #24290) thanks @Kay-051.
- Agents/Reasoning: avoid classifying provider reasoning-required errors as context overflows so these failures no longer trigger compaction-style overflow recovery. (#24593) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Models: codify `agents.defaults.model` / `agents.defaults.imageModel` config-boundary input as `string | {primary,fallbacks}`, split explicit vs effective model resolution, and fix `models status --agent` source attribution so defaults-inherited agents are labeled as `defaults` while runtime selection still honors defaults fallback. (#24210) thanks @bianbiandashen.
- Agents/Compaction: pass `agentDir` into manual `/compact` command runs so compaction auth/profile resolution stays scoped to the active agent. (#24133) thanks @Glucksberg.
- Agents/Compaction: pass model metadata through the embedded runtime so safeguard summarization can run when `ctx.model` is unavailable, avoiding repeated `"Summary unavailable due to context limits"` fallback summaries. (#3479) Thanks @battman21, @hanxiao and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: cancel safeguard compaction when summary generation cannot run (missing model/API key or summarization failure), preserving history instead of truncating to fallback `"Summary unavailable"` text. (#10711) Thanks @DukeDeSouth and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Tools: make `session_status` read transcript-derived usage mid-turn and tail-read session logs for cache-aware context reporting without full-log scans. (#22387) Thanks @1ucian.
- Agents/Overflow: detect additional provider context-overflow error shapes (including `input length` + `max_tokens` exceed-context variants) so failures route through compaction/recovery paths instead of leaking raw provider errors to users. (#9951) Thanks @echoVic and @Glucksberg.
- Agents/Overflow: add Chinese context-overflow pattern detection in `isContextOverflowError` so localized provider errors route through overflow recovery paths. (#22855) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Agents/Failover: treat HTTP 502/503/504 errors as failover-eligible transient timeouts so fallback chains can switch providers/models during upstream outages instead of retrying the same failing target. (#20999) Thanks @taw0002 and @vincentkoc.
- Auto-reply/Inbound metadata: hide direct-chat `message_id`/`message_id_full` and sender metadata only from normalized chat type (not sender-id sentinels), preserving group metadata visibility and preventing sender-id spoofed direct-mode classification. (#24373) thanks @jd316.
- Auto-reply/Inbound metadata: move dynamic inbound `flags` (reply/forward/thread/history) from system metadata to user-context conversation info, preventing turn-by-turn prompt-cache invalidation from flag toggles. (#21785) Thanks @aidiffuser.
- Auto-reply/Sessions: remove auth-key labels from `/new` and `/reset` confirmation messages so session reset notices never expose API key prefixes or env-key labels in chat output. (#24384, #24409) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Slack/Group policy: move Slack account `groupPolicy` defaulting to provider-level schema defaults so multi-account configs inherit top-level `channels.slack.groupPolicy` instead of silently overriding inheritance with per-account `allowlist`. (#17579) Thanks @ZetiMente.
- Providers/Anthropic: skip `context-1m-*` beta injection for OAuth/subscription tokens (`sk-ant-oat-*`) while preserving OAuth-required betas, avoiding Anthropic 401 auth failures when `params.context1m` is enabled. (#10647, #20354) Thanks @ClumsyWizardHands and @dcruver.
- Providers/DashScope: mark DashScope-compatible `openai-completions` endpoints as `supportsDeveloperRole=false` so OpenClaw sends `system` instead of unsupported `developer` role on Qwen/DashScope APIs. (#19130) Thanks @Putzhuawa and @vincentkoc.
- Providers/Bedrock: disable prompt-cache retention for non-Anthropic Bedrock models so Nova/Mistral requests do not send unsupported cache metadata. (#20866) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Providers/Bedrock: apply Anthropic-Claude cacheRetention defaults and runtime pass-through for `amazon-bedrock/*anthropic.claude*` model refs, while keeping non-Anthropic Bedrock models excluded. (#22303) Thanks @snese.
- Providers/OpenRouter: remove conflicting top-level `reasoning_effort` when injecting nested `reasoning.effort`, preventing OpenRouter 400 payload-validation failures for reasoning models. (#24120) thanks @tenequm.
- Providers/Groq: avoid classifying Groq TPM limit errors as context overflow so throttling paths no longer trigger overflow recovery logic. (#16176) Thanks @dddabtc.
- Gateway/WS: close repeated post-handshake `unauthorized role:*` request floods per connection and sample duplicate rejection logs, preventing a single misbehaving client from degrading gateway responsiveness. (#20168) Thanks @acy103, @vibecodooor, and @vincentkoc.
- Gateway/Restart: treat child listener PIDs as owned by the service runtime PID during restart health checks to avoid false stale-process kills and restart timeouts on launchd/systemd. (#24696) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Config/Write: apply `unsetPaths` with immutable path-copy updates so config writes never mutate caller-provided objects, and harden `openclaw config get/set/unset` path traversal by rejecting prototype-key segments and inherited-property traversal. (#24134) thanks @frankekn.
- Channels/WhatsApp: accept `channels.whatsapp.enabled` in config validation to match built-in channel auto-enable behavior, preventing `Unrecognized key: "enabled"` failures during channel setup. (#24263)
- Security/Exec: detect obfuscated commands before exec allowlist decisions and require explicit approval for obfuscation patterns. (#8592) Thanks @CornBrother0x and @vincentkoc.
- Security/ACP: harden ACP client permission auto-approval to require trusted core tool IDs, ignore untrusted `toolCall.kind` hints, and scope `read` auto-approval to the active working directory so unknown tool names and out-of-scope file reads always prompt. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Skills: escape user-controlled prompt, filename, and output-path values in `openai-image-gen` HTML gallery generation to prevent stored XSS in generated `index.html` output. (#12538) Thanks @CornBrother0x.
- Security/Skills: harden `skill-creator` packaging by skipping symlink entries and rejecting files whose resolved paths escape the selected skill root. (#24260, #16959) Thanks @CornBrother0x and @vincentkoc.
- Security/OTEL: redact sensitive values (API keys, tokens, credential fields) from diagnostics-otel log bodies, log attributes, and error/reason span fields before OTLP export. (#12542) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Security/CI: add pre-commit security hook coverage for private-key detection and production dependency auditing, and enforce those checks in CI alongside baseline secret scanning. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Skills/Python: harden skill script packaging and validation edge cases (self-including `.skill` outputs, CRLF frontmatter parsing, strict `--days` validation, and safer image file loading), with expanded Python regression coverage. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Skills/Python: add CI + pre-commit linting (`ruff`) and pytest discovery coverage for Python scripts/tests under `skills/`, including package test execution from repo root. Thanks @vincentkoc.

## 2026.2.22

### Changes

- Control UI/Agents: make the Tools panel data-driven from runtime `tools.catalog`, add per-tool provenance labels (`core` / `plugin:<id>` + optional marker), and keep a static fallback list when the runtime catalog is unavailable.
- Web Search/Gemini: add grounded Gemini provider support with provider auto-detection and config/docs updates. (#13075, #13074) Thanks @akoscz.
- Control UI/Cron: add full web cron edit parity (including clone and richer validation/help text), plus all-jobs run history with pagination/search/sort/multi-filter controls and improved cron page layout for cleaner scheduling and failure triage workflows.
- Provider/Mistral: add support for the Mistral provider, including memory embeddings and voice support. (#23845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Update/Core: add an optional built-in auto-updater for package installs (`update.auto.*`), default-off, with stable rollout delay+jitter and beta hourly cadence.
- CLI/Update: add `openclaw update --dry-run` to preview channel/tag/target/restart actions without mutating config, installing, syncing plugins, or restarting.
- Config/UI: add tag-aware settings filtering and broaden config labels/help copy so fields are easier to discover and understand in the dashboard config screen.
- Channels/Synology Chat: add a native Synology Chat channel plugin with webhook ingress, direct-message routing, outbound send/media support, per-account config, and DM policy controls. (#23012)
- iOS/Talk: prefetch TTS segments and suppress expected speech-cancellation errors for smoother talk playback. (#22833) Thanks @ngutman.
- Memory/FTS: add Spanish and Portuguese stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode, improving conversational recall for both languages. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Japanese-aware query expansion tokenization and stop-word filtering (including mixed-script terms like ASCII + katakana) for FTS-only search mode. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Memory/FTS: add Korean stop-word filtering and particle-aware keyword extraction (including mixed Korean/English stems) for query expansion in FTS-only search mode. (#18899) Thanks @ruypang.
- Memory/FTS: add Arabic stop-word filtering for query expansion in FTS-only search mode to reduce conversational filler in Arabic memory searches. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Discord/Allowlist: canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs and split resolution flow for clearer fail-closed behavior.
- Channels/Config: unify channel preview streaming config handling with a shared resolver and canonical migration path.
- Gateway/Auth: unify call/probe/status/auth credential-source precedence on shared resolver helpers, with table-driven parity coverage across gateway entrypoints.
- Gateway/Auth: refactor gateway credential resolution and websocket auth handshake paths to use shared typed auth contexts, including explicit `auth.deviceToken` support in connect frames and tests.
- Skills: remove bundled `food-order` skill from this repo; manage/install it from ClawHub instead.
- Docs/Subagents: make thread-bound session guidance channel-first instead of Discord-specific, and list thread-supporting channels explicitly. (#23589) Thanks @osolmaz.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** removed Google Antigravity provider support and the bundled `google-antigravity-auth` plugin. Existing `google-antigravity/*` model/profile configs no longer work; migrate to `google-gemini-cli` or other supported providers.
- **BREAKING:** tool-failure replies now hide raw error details by default. OpenClaw still sends a failure summary, but detailed error suffixes (for example provider/runtime messages and local path fragments) now require `/verbose on` or `/verbose full`.
- **BREAKING:** CLI local onboarding now sets `session.dmScope` to `per-channel-peer` by default for new/implicit DM scope configuration. If you depend on shared DM continuity across senders, explicitly set `session.dmScope` to `main`. (#23468) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- **BREAKING:** unify channel preview-streaming config to `channels.<channel>.streaming` with enum values `off | partial | block | progress`, and move Slack native stream toggle to `channels.slack.nativeStreaming`. Legacy keys (`streamMode`, Slack boolean `streaming`) are still read and migrated by `openclaw doctor --fix`, but canonical saved config/docs now use the unified names.
- **BREAKING:** remove legacy Gateway device-auth signature `v1`. Device-auth clients must now sign `v2` payloads with the per-connection `connect.challenge` nonce and send `device.nonce`; nonce-less connects are rejected.

### Fixes

- Sessions/Resilience: ignore invalid persisted `sessionFile` metadata and fall back to the derived safe transcript path instead of aborting session resolution for handlers and tooling. (#16061) Thanks @haoyifan and @vincentkoc.
- Sessions/Paths: resolve symlinked state-dir aliases during transcript-path validation while preserving safe cross-agent/state-root compatibility for valid `agents/<id>/sessions/**` paths. (#18593) Thanks @EpaL and @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: count auto-compactions only after a non-retry `auto_compaction_end`, keeping session `compactionCount` aligned to completed compactions.
- Security/CLI: redact sensitive values in `openclaw config get` output before printing config paths, preventing credential leakage to terminal output/history. (#13683) Thanks @SleuthCo.
- Agents/Moonshot: force `supportsDeveloperRole=false` for Moonshot-compatible `openai-completions` models (provider `moonshot` and Moonshot base URLs), so initial runs no longer send unsupported `developer` roles that trigger `ROLE_UNSPECIFIED` errors. (#21060, #22194) Thanks @ShengFuC.
- Agents/Kimi: classify Moonshot `Your request exceeded model token limit` failures as context overflows so auto-compaction and user-facing overflow recovery trigger correctly instead of surfacing raw invalid-request errors. (#9562) Thanks @danilofalcao.
- Providers/Moonshot: mark Kimi K2.5 as image-capable in implicit + onboarding model definitions, and refresh stale explicit provider capability fields (`input`/`reasoning`/context limits) from implicit catalogs so existing configs pick up Moonshot vision support without manual model rewrites. (#13135, #4459) Thanks @manikv12.
- Agents/Transcript: enable consecutive-user turn merging for strict non-OpenAI `openai-completions` providers (for example Moonshot/Kimi), reducing `roles must alternate` ordering failures on OpenAI-compatible endpoints while preserving current OpenRouter/Opencode behavior. (#7693)
- Install/Discord Voice: make `@discordjs/opus` an optional dependency so `openclaw` install/update no longer hard-fails when native Opus builds fail, while keeping `opusscript` as the runtime fallback decoder for Discord voice flows. (#23737, #23733, #23703) Thanks @jeadland, @Sheetaa, and @Breakyman.
- Docker/Setup: precreate `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR/identity` during `docker-setup.sh` so CLI commands that need device identity (for example `devices list`) avoid `EACCES ... /home/node/.openclaw/identity` failures on restrictive bind mounts. (#23948) Thanks @ackson-beep.
- Exec/Background: stop applying the default exec timeout to background sessions (`background: true` or explicit `yieldMs`) when no explicit timeout is set, so long-running background jobs are no longer terminated at the default timeout boundary. (#23303)
- Slack/Threading: sessions: keep parent-session forking and thread-history context active beyond first turn by removing first-turn-only gates in session init, thread-history fetch, and reply prompt context injection. (#23843, #23090) Thanks @vincentkoc and @Taskle.
- Slack/Threading: respect `replyToMode` when Slack auto-populates top-level `thread_ts`, and ignore inline `replyToId` directive tags when `replyToMode` is `off` so thread forcing stays disabled unless explicitly configured. (#23839, #23320, #23513) Thanks @vincentkoc and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Extension: forward `message read` `threadId` to `readMessages` and use delivery-context `threadId` as outbound `thread_ts` fallback so extension replies/reads stay in the correct Slack thread. (#22216, #22485, #23836) Thanks @vincentkoc, @lan17 and @dorukardahan.
- Slack/Upload: resolve bare user IDs (U-prefix) to DM channel IDs via `conversations.open` before calling `files.uploadV2`, which rejects non-channel IDs. `chat.postMessage` tolerates user IDs directly, but `files.uploadV2` → `completeUploadExternal` validates `channel_id` against `^[CGDZ][A-Z0-9]{8,}$`, causing `invalid_arguments` when agents reply with media to DM conversations.
- Webchat/Chat: apply assistant `final` payload messages directly to chat state so sent turns render without waiting for a full history refresh cycle. (#14928) Thanks @BradGroux.
- Webchat/Chat: for out-of-band final events (for example tool-call side runs), append provided final assistant payloads directly instead of forcing a transient history reset. (#11139) Thanks @AkshayNavle.
- Webchat/Performance: reload `chat.history` after final events only when the final payload lacks a renderable assistant message, avoiding expensive full-history refreshes on normal turns. (#20588) Thanks @amzzzzzzz.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve external session routing metadata when internal `chat.send` turns run under `webchat`, so explicit channel-keyed sessions (for example Telegram) no longer get rewritten to `webchat` and misroute follow-up delivery. (#23258) Thanks @binary64.
- Webchat/Sessions: preserve existing session `label` across `/new` and `/reset` rollovers so reset sessions remain discoverable in session history lists. (#23755) Thanks @ThunderStormer.
- Gateway/Chat UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags from non-streaming final webchat broadcasts (including `chat.inject`) while preserving empty-string message content when tags are the entire reply. (#23298) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Chat/UI: strip inline reply/audio directive tags (`[[reply_to_current]]`, `[[reply_to:<id>]]`, `[[audio_as_voice]]`) from displayed chat history, live chat event output, and session preview snippets so control tags no longer leak into user-visible surfaces.
- Gateway/Chat UI: sanitize non-streaming final `chat.send`/`chat.inject` payload text with the same envelope/untrusted-context stripping used by `chat.history`, preventing `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT...>>>` wrapper markup from rendering in Control UI chat. (#24012) Thanks @mittelaltergouda.
- Telegram/Media: send a user-facing Telegram reply when media download fails (non-size errors) instead of silently dropping the message.
- Telegram/Webhook: keep webhook monitors alive until gateway abort signals fire, preventing false channel exits and immediate webhook auto-restart loops.
- Telegram/Polling: retry recoverable setup-time network failures in monitor startup and await runner teardown before retry to avoid overlapping polling sessions.
- Telegram/Polling: clear Telegram webhooks (`deleteWebhook`) before starting long-poll `getUpdates`, including retry handling for transient cleanup failures.
- Telegram/Webhook: add `channels.telegram.webhookPort` config support and pass it through plugin startup wiring to the monitor listener.
- Browser/Extension Relay: refactor the MV3 worker to preserve debugger attachments across relay drops, auto-reconnect with bounded backoff+jitter, persist and rehydrate attached tab state via `chrome.storage.session`, recover from `target_closed` navigation detaches, guard stale socket handlers, enforce per-tab operation locks and per-request timeouts, and add lifecycle keepalive/badge refresh hooks (`alarms`, `webNavigation`). (#15099, #6175, #8468, #9807)
- Browser/Relay: treat extension websocket as connected only when `OPEN`, allow reconnect when a stale `CLOSING/CLOSED` extension socket lingers, and guard stale socket message/close handlers so late events cannot clear active relay state; includes regression coverage for live-duplicate `409` rejection and immediate reconnect-after-close races. (#15099, #18698, #20688)
- Browser/Remote CDP: extend stale-target recovery so `ensureTabAvailable()` now reuses the sole available tab for remote CDP profiles (same behavior as extension profiles) while preserving strict `tab not found` errors when multiple tabs exist; includes remote-profile regression tests. (#15989)
- Gateway/Pairing: treat `operator.admin` as satisfying other `operator.*` scope checks during device-auth verification so local CLI/TUI sessions stop entering pairing-required loops for pairing/approval-scoped commands. (#22062, #22193, #21191) Thanks @Botaccess, @jhartshorn, and @ctbritt.
- Gateway/Pairing: auto-approve loopback `scope-upgrade` pairing requests (including device-token reconnects) so local clients do not disconnect on pairing-required scope elevation. (#23708) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Gateway/Scopes: include `operator.read` and `operator.write` in default operator connect scope bundles across CLI, Control UI, and macOS clients so write-scoped announce/sub-agent follow-up calls no longer hit `pairing required` disconnects on loopback gateways. (#22582) thanks @YuzuruS.
- Gateway/Pairing: treat operator.admin pairing tokens as satisfying operator.write requests so legacy devices stop looping through scope-upgrade prompts introduced in 2026.2.19. (#23125, #23006) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Gateway/Restart: fix restart-loop edge cases by keeping `openclaw.mjs -> dist/entry.js` bootstrap detection explicit, reacquiring the gateway lock for in-process restart fallback paths, and tightening restart-loop regression coverage. (#23416) Thanks @jeffwnli.
- Gateway/Lock: use optional gateway-port reachability as a primary stale-lock liveness signal (and wire gateway run-loop lock acquisition to the resolved port), reducing false "already running" lockouts after unclean exits. (#23760) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Delivery/Queue: quarantine queue entries immediately on known permanent delivery errors (for example invalid recipients or missing conversation references) by moving them to `failed/` instead of retrying on every restart. (#23794) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Cron/Status: split execution outcome (`lastRunStatus`) from delivery outcome (`lastDeliveryStatus`) in persisted cron state, finished events, and run history so failed/unknown announcement delivery is visible without conflating it with run errors.
- Cron/Delivery: route text-only announce jobs with explicit thread/topic targets through direct outbound delivery so forum/thread destinations do not get dropped by intermediary announce turns. (#23841) Thanks @AndrewArto.
- Cron: honor `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` in the timer loop so due jobs can execute up to the configured parallelism instead of always running serially. (#11595) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Cron/Run: enforce the same per-job timeout guard for manual `cron.run` executions as timer-driven runs, including abort propagation for isolated agent jobs, so forced runs cannot wedge indefinitely. (#23704) Thanks @tkuehnl.
- Cron/Run: persist the manual-run `runningAtMs` marker before releasing the cron lock so overlapping timer ticks cannot start the same job concurrently.
- Cron/Startup: enforce per-job timeout guards for startup catch-up replay runs so missed isolated jobs cannot hang indefinitely during gateway boot recovery.
- Cron/Main session: honor abort/timeout signals while retrying `wakeMode=now` heartbeat contention loops so main-target cron runs stop promptly instead of waiting through the full busy-retry window.
- Cron/Schedule: for `every` jobs, prefer `lastRunAtMs + everyMs` when still in the future after restarts, then fall back to anchor scheduling for catch-up windows, so NEXT timing matches the last successful cadence. (#22895) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Cron/Service: execute manual `cron.run` jobs outside the cron lock (while still persisting started/finished state atomically) so `cron.list` and `cron.status` remain responsive during long forced runs. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Timer: keep a watchdog recheck timer armed while `onTimer` is actively executing so the scheduler continues polling even if a due-run tick stalls for an extended period. (#23628) Thanks @dsgraves.
- Cron/Run log: clean up settled per-path run-log write queue entries so long-running cron uptime does not retain stale promise bookkeeping in memory.
- Cron/Run log: harden `cron.runs` run-log path resolution by rejecting path-separator `id`/`jobId` inputs and enforcing reads within the per-cron `runs/` directory.
- Cron/Announce: when announce delivery target resolution fails (for example multiple configured channels with no explicit target), skip injecting fallback `Cron (error): ...` into the main session so runs fail cleanly without accidental last-route sends. (#24074)
- Cron/Telegram: validate cron `delivery.to` with shared Telegram target parsing and resolve legacy `@username`/`t.me` targets to numeric IDs at send-time for deterministic delivery target writeback. (#21930) Thanks @kesor.
- Telegram/Targets: normalize unprefixed topic-qualified targets through the shared parse/normalize path so valid `@channel:topic:<id>` and `<chatId>:topic:<id>` routes are recognized again. (#24166) Thanks @obviyus.
- Cron/Isolation: force fresh session IDs for isolated cron runs so `sessionTarget="isolated"` executions never reuse prior run context. (#23470) Thanks @echoVic.
- Plugins/Install: strip `workspace:*` devDependency entries from copied plugin manifests before `npm install --omit=dev`, preventing `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` install failures for npm-published channel plugins (including Feishu and MS Teams).
- Feishu/Plugins: restore bundled Feishu SDK availability for global installs and strip `openclaw: workspace:*` from plugin `devDependencies` during plugin-version sync so npm-installed Feishu plugins do not fail dependency install. (#23611, #23645, #23603)
- Config/Channels: auto-enable built-in channels by writing `channels.<id>.enabled=true` (not `plugins.entries.<id>`), and stop adding built-ins to `plugins.allow`, preventing `plugins.entries.telegram: plugin not found` validation failures.
- Config/Channels: when `plugins.allow` is active, auto-enable/enable flows now also allowlist configured built-in channels so `channels.<id>.enabled=true` cannot remain blocked by restrictive plugin allowlists.
- Plugins/Discovery: ignore scanned extension backup/disabled directory patterns (for example `.backup-*`, `.bak`, `.disabled*`) and move updater backup directories under `.openclaw-install-backups`, preventing duplicate plugin-id collisions from archived copies.
- Plugins/CLI: make `openclaw plugins enable` and plugin install/link flows update allowlists via shared plugin-enable policy so enabled plugins are not left disabled by allowlist mismatch. (#23190) Thanks @downwind7clawd-ctrl.
- Security/Voice Call: harden media stream WebSocket handling against pre-auth idle-connection DoS by adding strict pre-start timeouts, pending/per-IP connection limits, and total connection caps for streaming endpoints. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Sessions: redact sensitive token patterns from `sessions_history` tool output and surface `contentRedacted` metadata when masking occurs. (#16928) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Exec: stop trusting `PATH`-derived directories for safe-bin allowlist checks, add explicit `tools.exec.safeBinTrustedDirs`, and pin safe-bin shell execution to resolved absolute executable paths to prevent binary-shadowing approval bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Elevated: match `tools.elevated.allowFrom` against sender identities only (not recipient `ctx.To`), closing a recipient-token bypass for `/elevated` authorization. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Feishu: enforce ID-only allowlist matching for DM/group sender authorization, normalize Feishu ID prefixes during checks, and ignore mutable display names so display-name collisions cannot satisfy allowlist entries. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Security/Group policy: harden `channels.*.groups.*.toolsBySender` matching by requiring explicit sender-key types (`id:`, `e164:`, `username:`, `name:`), preventing cross-identifier collisions across mutable/display-name fields while keeping legacy untyped keys on a deprecated ID-only path. Thanks @jiseoung for reporting.
- Channels/Group policy: fail closed when `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` is set without explicit `groups`, honor account-level `groupPolicy` overrides, and enforce `groupPolicy: "disabled"` as a hard group block. (#22215) Thanks @etereo.
- Telegram/Discord extensions: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through extension outbound `sendMedia` options so extension direct-send media paths honor agent-scoped local-media allowlists. (#20029, #21903, #23227)
- Agents/Exec: honor explicit agent context when resolving `tools.exec` defaults for runs with opaque/non-agent session keys, so per-agent `host/security/ask` policies are applied consistently. (#11832)
- CLI/Sessions: resolve implicit session-store path templates with the configured default agent ID so named-agent setups do not silently read/write stale `agent:main` session/auth stores. (#22685) Thanks @sene1337.
- Doctor/Security: add an explicit warning that `approvals.exec.enabled=false` disables forwarding only, while enforcement remains driven by host-local `exec-approvals.json` policy. (#15047)
- Sandbox/Docker: default sandbox container user to the workspace owner `uid:gid` when `agents.*.sandbox.docker.user` is unset, fixing non-root gateway file-tool permissions under capability-dropped containers. (#20979)
- Plugins/Media sandbox: propagate trusted `mediaLocalRoots` through plugin action dispatch (including Discord/Telegram action adapters) so plugin send paths enforce the same agent-scoped local-media sandbox roots as core outbound sends. (#20258, #22718)
- Agents/Workspace guard: map sandbox container-workdir file-tool paths (for example `/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) to host workspace roots before workspace-only validation, preventing false `Path escapes sandbox root` rejections for sandbox file tools. (#9560)
- Gateway/Exec approvals: expire approval requests immediately when no approval-capable gateway clients are connected and no forwarding targets are available, avoiding delayed approvals after restarts/offline approver windows. (#22144)
- Security/Exec approvals: when approving wrapper commands with allow-always in allowlist mode, persist inner executable paths for known dispatch wrappers (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout`) and fail closed (no persisted entry) when wrapper unwrapping is not safe, preventing wrapper-path approval bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Node/macOS exec host: default headless macOS node `system.run` to local execution and only route through the companion app when `OPENCLAW_NODE_EXEC_HOST=app` is explicitly set, avoiding companion-app filesystem namespace mismatches during exec. (#23547)
- Sandbox/Media: map container workspace paths (`/workspace/...` and `file:///workspace/...`) back to the host sandbox root for outbound media validation, preventing false deny errors for sandbox-generated local media. (#23083) Thanks @echo931.
- Sandbox/Docker: apply custom bind mounts after workspace mounts and prioritize bind-source resolution on overlapping paths, so explicit workspace binds are no longer ignored. (#22669) Thanks @tasaankaeris.
- Exec approvals/Forwarding: restore Discord text forwarding when component approvals are not configured, and carry request snapshots through resolve events so resolved notices still forward after cache misses/restarts. (#22988) Thanks @bubmiller.
- Control UI/WebSocket: stop and clear the browser gateway client on UI teardown so remounts cannot leave orphan websocket clients that create duplicate active connections. (#23422) Thanks @floatinggball-design.
- Control UI/WebSocket: send a stable per-tab `instanceId` in websocket connect frames so reconnect cycles keep a consistent client identity for diagnostics and presence tracking. (#23616) Thanks @zq58855371-ui.
- Config/Memory: allow `"mistral"` in `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider` and `agents.defaults.memorySearch.fallback` schema validation. (#14934) Thanks @ThomsenDrake.
- Feishu/Commands: in group chats, command authorization now falls back to top-level `channels.feishu.allowFrom` when per-group `allowFrom` is not set, so `/command` no longer gets blocked by an unintended empty allowlist. (#23756)
- Dev tooling: prevent `CLAUDE.md` symlink target regressions by excluding CLAUDE symlink sentinels from `oxfmt` and marking them `-text` in `.gitattributes`, so formatter/EOL normalization cannot reintroduce trailing-newline targets. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Agents/Compaction: restore embedded compaction safeguard/context-pruning extension loading in production by wiring bundled extension factories into the resource loader instead of runtime file-path resolution. (#22349) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Feishu/Media: for inbound video messages that include both `file_key` (video) and `image_key` (thumbnail), prefer `file_key` when downloading media so video attachments are saved instead of silently failing on thumbnail keys. (#23633)
- Hooks/Loader: avoid redundant hook-module recompilation on gateway restart by skipping cache-busting for bundled hooks and using stable file metadata keys (`mtime+size`) for mutable workspace/managed/plugin hook imports. (#16953) Thanks @mudrii.
- Hooks/Cron: suppress duplicate main-session events for delivered hook turns and mark `SILENT_REPLY_TOKEN` (`NO_REPLY`) early exits as delivered to prevent hook context pollution. (#20678) Thanks @JonathanWorks.
- Providers/OpenRouter: inject `cache_control` on system prompts for OpenRouter Anthropic models to improve prompt-cache reuse. (#17473) Thanks @rrenamed.
- Installer/Smoke tests: remove legacy `OPENCLAW_USE_GUM` overrides from docker install-smoke runs so tests exercise installer auto TTY detection behavior directly.
- Providers/OpenRouter: allow pass-through OpenRouter and Opencode model IDs in live model filtering so custom routed model IDs are treated as modern refs. (#14312) Thanks @Joly0.
- Providers/OpenRouter: default reasoning to enabled when the selected model advertises `reasoning: true` and no session/directive override is set. (#22513) Thanks @zwffff.
- Providers/OpenRouter: map `/think` levels to `reasoning.effort` in embedded runs while preserving explicit `reasoning.max_tokens` payloads. (#17236) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve stored session provider when model IDs are vendor-prefixed (for example, `anthropic/...`) so follow-up turns do not incorrectly route to direct provider APIs. (#22753) Thanks @dndodson.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve the required `openrouter/` prefix for OpenRouter-native model IDs during model-ref normalization. (#12942) Thanks @omair445.
- Providers/OpenRouter: pass through provider routing parameters from model params.provider to OpenRouter request payloads for provider selection controls. (#17148) Thanks @carrotRakko.
- Providers/OpenRouter: preserve model allowlist entries containing OpenRouter preset paths (for example `openrouter/@preset/...`) by treating `/model ...@profile` auth-profile parsing as a suffix-only override. (#14120) Thanks @NotMainstream.
- Cron/Auth: propagate auth-profile resolution to isolated cron sessions so provider API keys are resolved the same way as main sessions, fixing 401 errors when using providers configured via auth-profiles. (#20689) Thanks @lailoo.
- Cron/Follow-up: pass resolved `agentDir` through isolated cron and queued follow-up embedded runs so auth/profile lookups stay scoped to the correct agent directory. (#22845) Thanks @seilk.
- Agents/Media: route tool-result `MEDIA:` extraction through shared parser validation so malformed prose like `MEDIA:-prefixed ...` is no longer treated as a local file path (prevents Telegram ENOENT tool-error overrides). (#18780) Thanks @HOYALIM.
- Logging: cap single log-file size with `logging.maxFileBytes` (default 500 MB) and suppress additional writes after cap hit to prevent disk exhaustion from repeated error storms.
- Memory/Remote HTTP: centralize remote memory HTTP calls behind a shared guarded helper (`withRemoteHttpResponse`) so embeddings and batch flows use one request/release path.
- Memory/Embeddings: apply configured remote-base host pinning (`allowedHostnames`) across OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini embedding requests to keep private/self-hosted endpoints working without cross-host drift. (#18198) Thanks @ianpcook.
- Memory/Batch: route OpenAI/Voyage/Gemini batch upload/create/status/download requests through the same guarded HTTP path for consistent SSRF policy enforcement.
- Memory/Index: detect memory source-set changes (for example enabling `sessions` after an existing memory-only index) and trigger a full reindex so existing session transcripts are indexed without requiring `--force`. (#17576) Thanks @TarsAI-Agent.
- Memory/Embeddings: enforce a per-input 8k safety cap before embedding batching and apply a conservative 2k fallback limit for local providers without declared input limits, preventing oversized session/memory chunks from triggering provider context-size failures during sync/indexing. (#6016) Thanks @batumilove.
- Memory/QMD: on Windows, resolve bare `qmd`/`mcporter` command names to npm shim executables (`.cmd`) before spawning, so qmd boot updates and mcporter-backed searches no longer fail with `spawn ... ENOENT` on default npm installs. (#23899) Thanks @arcbuilder-ai.
- Memory/QMD: parse plain-text `qmd collection list --json` output when older qmd builds ignore JSON mode, and retry memory searches once after re-ensuring managed collections when qmd returns `Collection not found ...`. (#23613) Thanks @leozhucn.
- iOS/Watch: normalize watch quick-action notification payloads, support mirrored indexed actions beyond primary/secondary, and fix iOS test-target signing/compile blockers for watch notify coverage. (#23636) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Signal/RPC: guard malformed Signal RPC JSON responses with a clear status-scoped error and add regression coverage for invalid JSON responses. (#22995) Thanks @adhitShet.
- Gateway/Subagents: guard gateway and subagent session-key/message trim paths against undefined inputs to prevent early `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes during subagent spawn and wait flows.
- Agents/Workspace: guard `resolveUserPath` against undefined/null input to prevent `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` crashes when workspace paths are missing in embedded runner flows.
- Auth/Profiles: keep active `cooldownUntil`/`disabledUntil` windows immutable across retries so mid-window failures cannot extend recovery indefinitely; only recompute a backoff window after the previous deadline has expired. This resolves cron/inbound retry loops that could trap gateways until manual `usageStats` cleanup. (#23516, #23536) Thanks @arosstale.
- Channels/Security: fail closed on missing provider group policy config by defaulting runtime group policy to `allowlist` (instead of inheriting `channels.defaults.groupPolicy`) when `channels.<provider>` is absent across message channels, and align runtime + security warnings/docs to the same fallback behavior (Slack, Discord, iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Matrix, Mattermost, Google Chat, IRC, Nextcloud Talk, Feishu, and Zalo user flows; plus Discord message/native-command paths). (#23367) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Gateway/Onboarding: harden remote gateway onboarding defaults and guidance by defaulting discovered direct URLs to `wss://`, rejecting insecure non-loopback `ws://` targets in onboarding validation, and expanding remote-security remediation messaging across gateway client/call/doctor flows. (#23476) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- CLI/Sessions: pass the configured sessions directory when resolving transcript paths in `agentCommand`, so custom `session.store` locations resume sessions reliably. Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Signal/Monitor: treat user-initiated abort shutdowns as clean exits when auto-started `signal-cli` is terminated, while still surfacing unexpected daemon exits as startup/runtime failures. (#23379) Thanks @frankekn.
- Channels/Dedupe: centralize plugin dedupe primitives in plugin SDK (memory + persistent), move Feishu inbound dedupe to a namespace-scoped persistent store, and reuse shared dedupe cache logic for Zalo webhook replay + Tlon processed-message tracking to reduce duplicate handling during reconnect/replay paths. (#23377) Thanks @SidQin-cyber.
- Channels/Delivery: remove hardcoded WhatsApp delivery fallbacks; require explicit/session channel context or auto-pick the sole configured channel when unambiguous. (#23357) Thanks @lbo728.
- ACP/Gateway: wait for gateway hello before opening ACP requests, and fail fast on pre-hello connect failures to avoid startup hangs and early `gateway not connected` request races. (#23390) Thanks @janckerchen.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` env override precedence for remote gateway call credentials after shared resolver refactors, preventing stale configured remote passwords from overriding runtime secret rotation.
- Gateway/Auth: preserve shared-token `gateway token mismatch` auth errors when `auth.token` fallback device-token checks fail, and reserve `device token mismatch` guidance for explicit `auth.deviceToken` failures.
- Gateway/Tools: when agent tools pass an allowlisted `gatewayUrl` override, resolve local override tokens from env/config fallback but keep remote overrides strict to `gateway.remote.token`, preventing local token leakage to remote targets.
- Gateway/Client: keep cached device-auth tokens on `device token mismatch` closes when the client used explicit shared token/password credentials, avoiding accidental pairing-token churn during explicit-auth failures.
- Node host/Exec: keep strict Windows allowlist behavior for `cmd.exe /c` shell-wrapper runs, and return explicit approval guidance when blocked (`SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss`).
- Control UI: show pairing-required guidance (commands + mobile tokenized URL reminder) when the dashboard disconnects with `1008 pairing required`.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` detection for open group policies that expose runtime/filesystem tools without sandbox/workspace guards (`security.exposure.open_groups_with_runtime_or_fs`).
- Security/Audit: make `gateway.real_ip_fallback_enabled` severity conditional for loopback trusted-proxy setups (warn for loopback-only `trustedProxies`, critical when non-loopback proxies are trusted). (#23428) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/Exec env: block request-scoped `HOME` and `ZDOTDIR` overrides in host exec env sanitizers (Node + macOS), preventing shell startup-file execution before allowlist-evaluated command bodies. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec env: block `SHELLOPTS`/`PS4` in host exec env sanitizers and restrict shell-wrapper (`bash|sh|zsh ... -c/-lc`) request env overrides to a small explicit allowlist (`TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`) on both node host and macOS companion paths, preventing xtrace prompt command-substitution allowlist bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce `allowFrom` for direct-message outbound targets in all send modes (including `mode: "explicit"`), preventing sends to non-allowlisted numbers. (#20108) Thanks @zahlmann.
- Security/Exec approvals: fail closed on shell line continuations (`\\\n`/`\\\r\n`) and treat shell-wrapper execution as approval-required in allowlist mode, preventing `$\\` newline command-substitution bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: emit a startup security warning when insecure/dangerous config flags are enabled (including `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth=true`) and point operators to `openclaw security audit`.
- Security/Hooks auth: normalize hook auth rate-limit client IP keys so IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses share one throttle bucket, preventing dual-form auth-attempt budget bypasses. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: treat `env` and shell-dispatch wrappers as transparent during allowlist analysis on node-host and macOS companion paths so policy checks match the effective executable/inline shell payload instead of the wrapper binary, blocking wrapper-smuggled allowlist bypasses. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: require explicit safe-bin profiles for `tools.exec.safeBins` entries in allowlist mode (remove generic safe-bin profile fallback), and add `tools.exec.safeBinProfiles` for safe custom binaries so unprofiled interpreter-style entries cannot be treated as stdin-safe. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Channels: harden Slack external menu token handling by switching to CSPRNG tokens, validating token shape, requiring user identity for external option lookups, and avoiding fabricated timestamp `trigger_id` fallbacks; also switch Tlon Urbit channel IDs to CSPRNG UUIDs, centralize secure ID/token generation via shared infra helpers, and add a guardrail test to block new runtime `Date.now()+Math.random()` token/id patterns.
- Security/Hooks transforms: enforce symlink-safe containment for webhook transform module paths (including `hooks.transformsDir` and `hooks.mappings[].transform.module`) by resolving existing-path ancestors via realpath before import, while preserving in-root symlink support; add regression coverage for both escape and allow cases. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Telegram/WSL2: disable `autoSelectFamily` by default on WSL2 and memoize WSL2 detection in Telegram network decision logic to avoid repeated sync `/proc/version` probes on fetch/send paths. (#21916) Thanks @MizukiMachine.
- Telegram/Network: default Node 22+ DNS result ordering to `ipv4first` for Telegram fetch paths and add `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_DNS_RESULT_ORDER`/`channels.telegram.network.dnsResultOrder` overrides to reduce IPv6-path fetch failures. (#5405) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Telegram/Forward bursts: coalesce forwarded text+media updates through a dedicated forward lane debounce window that works with default inbound debounce config, while keeping forwarded control commands immediate. (#19476) thanks @napetrov.
- Telegram/Streaming: preserve archived draft preview mapping after flush and clean superseded reasoning preview bubbles so multi-message preview finals no longer cross-edit or orphan stale messages under send/rotation races. (#23202) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Replies: scope messaging-tool text/media dedupe to same-target sends only, so cross-target tool sends can no longer silently suppress Telegram final replies.
- Telegram/Replies: normalize `file://` and local-path media variants during messaging dedupe so equivalent media paths do not produce duplicate Telegram replies.
- Telegram/Replies: extract forwarded-origin context from unified reply targets (`reply_to_message` and `external_reply`) so forward+comment metadata is preserved across partial reply shapes. (#9720) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Polling: persist a safe update-offset watermark bounded by pending updates so crash/restart cannot skip queued lower `update_id` updates after out-of-order completion. (#23284) thanks @frankekn.
- Telegram/Polling: force-restart stuck runner instances when recoverable unhandled network rejections escape the polling task path, so polling resumes instead of silently stalling. (#19721) Thanks @jg-noncelogic.
- Slack/Slash commands: preserve the Bolt app receiver when registering external select options handlers so monitor startup does not crash on runtimes that require bound `app.options` calls. (#23209) Thanks @0xgaia.
- Slack/Telegram slash sessions: await session metadata persistence before dispatch so first-turn native slash runs do not race session-origin metadata updates. (#23065) thanks @hydro13.
- Slack/Queue routing: preserve string `thread_ts` values through collect-mode queue drain and DM `deliveryContext` updates so threaded follow-ups do not leak to the main channel when Slack thread IDs are strings. (#11934) Thanks @sandieman2 and @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Native commands: set `ctx.Provider="telegram"` for native slash-command context so elevated gate checks resolve provider correctly (fixes `provider (ctx.Provider)` failures in `/elevated` flows). (#23748) Thanks @serhii12.
- Agents/Ollama: preserve unsafe integer tool-call arguments as exact strings during NDJSON parsing, preventing large numeric IDs from being rounded before tool execution. (#23170) Thanks @BestJoester.
- Cron/Gateway: keep `cron.list` and `cron.status` responsive during startup catch-up by avoiding a long-held cron lock while missed jobs execute. (#23106) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Gateway/Config reload: compare array-valued config paths structurally during diffing so unchanged `memory.qmd.paths` and `memory.qmd.scope.rules` no longer trigger false restart-required reloads. (#23185) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Gateway/Config reload: retry short-lived missing config snapshots during reload before skipping, preventing atomic-write unlink windows from triggering restart loops. (#23343) Thanks @lbo728.
- Cron/Scheduling: validate runtime cron expressions before schedule/stagger evaluation so malformed persisted jobs report a clear `invalid cron schedule: expr is required` error instead of crashing with `undefined.trim` failures and auto-disable churn. (#23223) Thanks @asimons81.
- Memory/QMD: migrate legacy unscoped collection bindings (for example `memory-root`) to per-agent scoped names (for example `memory-root-main`) during startup when safe, so QMD-backed `memory_search` no longer fails with `Collection not found` after upgrades. (#23228, #20727) Thanks @JLDynamics and @AaronFaby.
- Memory/QMD: normalize Han-script BM25 search queries before invoking `qmd search` so mixed CJK+Latin prompts no longer return empty results due to tokenizer mismatch. (#23426) Thanks @LunaLee0130.
- TUI/Input: enable multiline-paste burst coalescing on macOS Terminal.app and iTerm so pasted blocks no longer submit line-by-line as separate messages. (#18809) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/RTL: isolate right-to-left script lines (Arabic/Hebrew ranges) with Unicode bidi isolation marks in TUI text sanitization so RTL assistant output no longer renders in reversed visual order in terminal chat panes. (#21936) Thanks @Asm3r96.
- TUI/Status: request immediate renders after setting `sending`/`waiting` activity states so in-flight runs always show visible progress indicators instead of appearing idle until completion. (#21549) Thanks @13Guinness.
- TUI/Input: arm Ctrl+C exit timing when clearing non-empty composer text and add a SIGINT fallback path so double Ctrl+C exits remain responsive during active runs instead of requiring an extra press or appearing stuck. (#23407) Thanks @tinybluedev.
- Agents/Fallbacks: treat JSON payloads with `type: "api_error"` + `"Internal server error"` as transient failover errors so Anthropic 500-style failures trigger model fallback. (#23193) Thanks @jarvis-lane.
- Agents/Google: sanitize non-base64 `thought_signature`/`thoughtSignature` values from assistant replay transcripts for native Google Gemini requests while preserving valid signatures and tool-call order. (#23457) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Transcripts: validate assistant tool-call names (syntax/length + registered tool allowlist) before transcript persistence and during replay sanitization so malformed failover tool names no longer poison sessions with repeated provider HTTP 400 errors. (#23324) Thanks @johnsantry.
- Agents/Mistral: sanitize tool-call IDs in the embedded agent loop and generate strict provider-safe pending tool-call IDs, preventing Mistral strict9 `HTTP 400` failures on tool continuations. (#23698) Thanks @echoVic.
- Agents/Compaction: strip stale assistant usage snapshots from pre-compaction turns when replaying history after a compaction summary so context-token estimation no longer reuses pre-compaction totals and immediately re-triggers destructive follow-up compactions. (#19127) Thanks @tedwatson.
- Agents/Replies: emit a default completion acknowledgement (`✅ Done.`) only for direct/private tool-only completions with no final assistant text, while suppressing synthetic acknowledgements for channel/group sessions and runs that already delivered output via messaging tools. (#22834) Thanks @Oldshue.
- Agents/Subagents: honor `tools.subagents.tools.alsoAllow` and explicit subagent `allow` entries when resolving built-in subagent deny defaults, so explicitly granted tools (for example `sessions_send`) are no longer blocked unless re-denied in `tools.subagents.tools.deny`. (#23359) Thanks @goren-beehero.
- Agents/Subagents: make announce call timeouts configurable via `agents.defaults.subagents.announceTimeoutMs` and restore a 60s default to prevent false timeout failures on slower announce paths. (#22719) Thanks @Valadon.
- Agents/Diagnostics: include resolved lifecycle error text in `embedded run agent end` warnings so UI/TUI “Connection error” runs expose actionable provider failure reasons in gateway logs. (#23054) Thanks @Raize.
- Agents/Auth profiles: resolve `agentCommand` session scope before choosing `agentDir`/workspace so resumed runs no longer read auth from `agents/main/agent` when the resolved session belongs to a different/default agent (for example `agent:exec:*` sessions). (#24016) Thanks @abersonFAC.
- Agents/Auth profiles: skip auth-profile cooldown writes for timeout failures in embedded runner rotation so model/network timeouts do not poison same-provider fallback model selection while still allowing in-turn account rotation. (#22622) Thanks @vageeshkumar.
- Plugins/Hooks: run legacy `before_agent_start` once per agent turn and reuse that result across model-resolve and prompt-build compatibility paths, preventing duplicate hook side effects (for example duplicate external API calls). (#23289) Thanks @ksato8710.
- Models/Config: default missing Anthropic provider/model `api` fields to `anthropic-messages` during config validation so custom relay model entries are preserved instead of being dropped by runtime model registry validation. (#23332) Thanks @bigbigmonkey123.
- Gateway/Pairing: preserve existing approved token scopes when processing repair pairings that omit `scopes`, preventing empty-scope token regressions on reconnecting clients. (#21906) Thanks @paki81.
- Memory/QMD: add optional `memory.qmd.mcporter` search routing so QMD `query/search/vsearch` can run through mcporter keep-alive flows (including multi-collection paths) to reduce cold starts, while keeping searches on agent-scoped QMD state for consistent recall. (#19617) Thanks @nicole-luxe and @vignesh07.
- Infra/Network: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as transient in unhandled-rejection detection even when nested causes are unclassified, preventing avoidable gateway crash loops on flaky networks. (#14345) Thanks @Unayung.
- Telegram/Retry: classify undici `TypeError: fetch failed` as recoverable in both polling and send retry paths so transient fetch failures no longer fail fast. (#16699) thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docs/Telegram: correct Node 22+ network defaults (`autoSelectFamily`, `dnsResultOrder`) and clarify Telegram setup does not use positional `openclaw channels login telegram`. (#23609) Thanks @ryanbastic.
- BlueBubbles/DM history: restore DM backfill context with account-scoped rolling history, bounded backfill retries, and safer history payload limits. (#20302) Thanks @Ryan-Haines.
- BlueBubbles/Private API cache: treat unknown (`null`) private-API cache status as disabled for send/attachment/reply flows to avoid stale-cache 500s, and log a warning when reply/effect features are requested while capability is unknown. (#23459) Thanks @echoVic.
- BlueBubbles/Webhooks: accept inbound/reaction webhook payloads when BlueBubbles omits `handle` but provides DM `chatGuid`, and harden payload extraction for array/string-wrapped message bodies so valid webhook events no longer get rejected as unparseable. (#23275) Thanks @toph31.
- Security/Audit: add `openclaw security audit` finding `gateway.nodes.allow_commands_dangerous` for risky `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` overrides, with severity upgraded to critical on remote gateway exposure.
- Gateway/Control plane: reduce cross-client write limiter contention by adding `connId` fallback keying when device ID and client IP are both unavailable.
- Security/Config: block prototype-key traversal during config merge patch and legacy migration merge helpers (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) to prevent prototype pollution during config mutation flows. (#22968) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Security/Shell env: validate login-shell executable paths for shell-env fallback (`/etc/shells` + trusted prefixes), block `SHELL`/`HOME`/`ZDOTDIR` in config env ingestion before fallback execution, and sanitize fallback shell exec env to pin `HOME` to the real user home while dropping `ZDOTDIR` and other dangerous startup vars. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Network/SSRF: enable `autoSelectFamily` on pinned undici dispatchers (with attempt timeout) so IPv6-unreachable environments can quickly fall back to IPv4 for guarded fetch paths. (#19950) Thanks @ENAwareness.
- Security/Config: make parsed chat allowlist checks fail closed when `allowFrom` is empty, restoring expected DM/pairing gating.
- Security/Exec: in non-default setups that manually add `sort` to `tools.exec.safeBins`, block `sort --compress-program` so allowlist-mode safe-bin checks cannot bypass approval. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Exec approvals: when users choose `allow-always` for shell-wrapper commands (for example `/bin/zsh -lc ...`), persist allowlist patterns for the inner executable(s) instead of the wrapper shell binary, preventing accidental broad shell allowlisting in moderate mode. (#23276) Thanks @xrom2863.
- Security/Exec: fail closed when `tools.exec.host=sandbox` is configured/requested but sandbox runtime is unavailable. (#23398) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Security/macOS app beta: enforce path-only `system.run` allowlist matching (drop basename matches like `echo`), migrate legacy basename entries to last resolved paths when available, and harden shell-chain handling to fail closed on unsafe parse/control syntax (including quoted command substitution/backticks). This is an optional allowlist-mode feature; default installs remain deny-by-default. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Agents: auto-generate and persist a dedicated `commands.ownerDisplaySecret` when `commands.ownerDisplay=hash`, remove gateway token fallback from owner-ID prompt hashing across CLI and embedded agent runners, and centralize owner-display secret resolution in one shared helper. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: expand IPv4 fetch guard blocking to include RFC special-use/non-global ranges (including benchmarking, TEST-NET, multicast, and reserved/broadcast blocks), centralize range checks into a single CIDR policy table, and reuse one shared host/IP classifier across literal + DNS checks to reduce classifier drift. Thanks @princeeismond-dot for reporting.
- Security/SSRF: block RFC2544 benchmarking range (`198.18.0.0/15`) across direct and embedded-IP paths, and normalize IPv6 dotted-quad transition literals (for example `::127.0.0.1`, `64:ff9b::8.8.8.8`) in shared IP parsing/classification.
- Security/Archive: block zip symlink escapes during archive extraction.
- Security/Media sandbox: keep tmp media allowance for absolute tmp paths only and enforce symlink-escape checks before sandbox-validated reads, preventing tmp symlink exfiltration and relative `../` sandbox escapes when sandboxes live under tmp. (#17892) Thanks @dashed.
- Browser/Upload: accept canonical in-root upload paths when the configured uploads directory is a symlink alias (for example `/tmp` -> `/private/tmp` on macOS), so browser upload validation no longer rejects valid files during client->server revalidation. (#23300, #23222, #22848) Thanks @bgaither4, @parkerati, and @Nabsku.
- Security/Discord: add `openclaw security audit` warnings for name/tag-based Discord allowlist entries (DM allowlists, guild/channel `users`, and pairing-store entries), highlighting slug-collision risk while keeping name-based matching supported, and canonicalize resolved Discord allowlist names to IDs at runtime without rewriting config files. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway: block node-role connections when device identity metadata is missing.
- Security/Media: enforce inbound media byte limits during download/read across Discord, Telegram, Zalo, Microsoft Teams, and BlueBubbles to prevent oversized payload memory spikes before rejection. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Media/Understanding: preserve `application/pdf` MIME classification during text-like file heuristics so PDF uploads use PDF extraction paths instead of being inlined as raw text. (#23191) Thanks @claudeplay2026-byte.
- Security/Control UI: block symlink-based out-of-root static file reads by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks when serving Control UI assets and SPA fallback `index.html`. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway avatars: block symlink traversal during local avatar `data:` URL resolution by enforcing realpath containment and file-identity checks before reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Control UI: centralize avatar URL/path validation across gateway/config helpers and enforce a 2 MB max size for local agent avatar files before `/avatar` resolution, reducing oversized-avatar memory risk without changing supported avatar formats.
- Security/Control UI avatars: harden `/avatar/:agentId` local avatar serving by rejecting symlink paths and requiring fd-level file identity + size checks before reads. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: enforce allowlist checks for SharePoint reference attachment URLs and redirect targets during Graph-backed media fetches so redirect chains cannot escape configured media host boundaries. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/MSTeams media: route attachment auth-retry and Graph SharePoint download redirects through shared `safeFetch` so each hop is validated with allowlist + DNS/IP checks across the full redirect chain. (#23598) Thanks @Asm3r96 and @lewiswigmore.
- Security/macOS discovery: fail closed for unresolved discovery endpoints by clearing stale remote selection values, use resolved service host only for SSH target derivation, and keep remote URL config aligned with resolved endpoint availability. (#21618) Thanks @bmendonca3.
- Chat/Usage/TUI: strip synthetic inbound metadata blocks (including `Conversation info` and trailing `Untrusted context` channel metadata wrappers) from displayed conversation history so internal prompt context no longer leaks into user-visible logs.
- CI/Tests: fix TypeScript case-table typing and lint assertion regressions so `pnpm check` passes again after Synology Chat landing. (#23012) Thanks @druide67.
- Security/Browser relay: harden extension relay auth token handling for `/extension` and `/cdp` pathways.
- Cron: persist `delivered` state in cron job records so delivery failures remain visible in status and logs. (#19174) Thanks @simonemacario.
- Config/Doctor: only repair the OAuth credentials directory when affected channels are configured, avoiding fresh-install noise.
- Config/Channels: whitelist `channels.modelByChannel` in config validation and exclude it from plugin auto-enable channel detection so model overrides no longer trigger `unknown channel id` validation errors or bogus `modelByChannel` plugin enables. (#23412) Thanks @ProspectOre.
- Config/Bindings: allow optional `bindings[].comment` in strict config validation so annotated binding entries no longer fail load. (#23458) Thanks @echoVic.
- Usage/Pricing: correct MiniMax M2.5 pricing defaults to fix inflated cost reporting. (#22755) Thanks @miloudbelarebia.
- Gateway/Daemon: verify gateway health after daemon restart.
- Agents/UI text: stop rewriting normal assistant billing/payment language outside explicit error contexts. (#17834) Thanks @niceysam.

- iOS/Watch: bridge mirrored watch prompt notification actions into iOS quick-reply handling, including queued action handoff until app model initialization. (#22123) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Gateway: stabilize background wake and reconnect behavior with background reconnect suppression/lease windows, BGAppRefresh wake fallback, location wake hook throttling, and APNs wake retry+nudge instrumentation. (#21226) thanks @mbelinky.
- Auto-reply/UI: add model fallback lifecycle visibility in verbose logs, /status active-model context with fallback reason, and cohesive WebUI fallback indicators. (#20704) Thanks @joshavant.
- MSTeams: dedupe sent-message cache storage by removing duplicate per-message Set storage and using timestamps Map keys as the single membership source. (#22514) Thanks @TaKO8Ki.
- Agents/Subagents: default subagent spawn depth now uses shared `maxSpawnDepth=2`, enabling depth-1 orchestrator spawning by default while keeping depth policy checks consistent across spawn and prompt paths. (#22223) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Security/Agents: make owner-ID obfuscation use a dedicated HMAC secret from configuration (`ownerDisplaySecret`) and update hashing behavior so obfuscation is decoupled from gateway token handling for improved control. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Infra: switch gateway lock and tool-call synthetic IDs from SHA-1 to SHA-256 with unchanged truncation length to strengthen hash basis while keeping deterministic behavior and lock key format. (#7343) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/Tooling: add non-blocking dead-code scans in CI via Knip/ts-prune/ts-unused-exports to surface unused dependencies and exports earlier. (#22468) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/Unused Dependencies: remove or scope unused root and extension deps (`@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk`, `signal-utils`, `ollama`, `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-express`, `@microsoft/agents-hosting-extensions-teams`, and plugin-local `openclaw` devDeps in `extensions/open-prose`, `extensions/lobster`, and `extensions/llm-task`). (#22471, #22495) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Dependencies/A2UI: harden dependency resolution after root cleanup (resolve `lit`, `@lit/context`, `@lit-labs/signals`, and `signal-utils` from workspace/root) and simplify bundling fallback behavior, including `pnpm dlx rolldown` compatibility. (#22481, #22507) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Agents/Bootstrap: skip malformed bootstrap files with missing/invalid paths instead of crashing agent sessions; hooks using `filePath` (or non-string `path`) are skipped with a warning. (#22693, #22698) Thanks @arosstale.
- Security/Agents: cap embedded Pi runner outer retry loop with a higher profile-aware dynamic limit (32-160 attempts) and return an explicit `retry_limit` error payload when retries never converge, preventing unbounded internal retry cycles (`GHSA-76m6-pj3w-v7mf`).
- Telegram: detect duplicate bot-token ownership across Telegram accounts at startup/status time, mark secondary accounts as not configured with an explicit fix message, and block duplicate account startup before polling to avoid endless `getUpdates` conflict loops.
- Agents/Tool images: include source filenames in `agents/tool-images` resize logs so compression events can be traced back to specific files.
- Providers/OAuth: harden Qwen and Chutes refresh handling by validating refresh response expiry values and preserving prior refresh tokens when providers return empty refresh token fields, with regression coverage for empty-token responses.
- Models/Kimi-Coding: add missing implicit provider template for `kimi-coding` with correct `anthropic-messages` API type and base URL, fixing 403 errors when using Kimi for Coding. (#22409)
- Auto-reply/Tools: forward `senderIsOwner` through embedded queued/followup runner params so owner-only tools remain available for authorized senders. (#22296) thanks @hcoj.
- Discord: restore model picker back navigation when a provider is missing and document the Discord picker flow. (#21458) Thanks @pejmanjohn and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory/QMD: respect per-agent `memorySearch.enabled=false` during gateway QMD startup initialization, split multi-collection QMD searches into per-collection queries (`search`/`vsearch`/`query`) to avoid sparse-term drops, prefer collection-hinted doc resolution to avoid stale-hash collisions, retry boot updates on transient lock/timeout failures, skip `qmd embed` in BM25-only `search` mode (including `memory index --force`), and serialize embed runs globally with failure backoff to prevent CPU storms on multi-agent hosts. (#20581, #21590, #20513, #20001, #21266, #21583, #20346, #19493) Thanks @danielrevivo, @zanderkrause, @sunyan034-cmd, @tilleulenspiegel, @dae-oss, @adamlongcreativellc, @jonathanadams96, and @kiliansitel.
- Memory/Builtin: prevent automatic sync races with manager shutdown by skipping post-close sync starts and waiting for in-flight sync before closing SQLite, so `onSearch`/`onSessionStart` no longer fail with `database is not open` in ephemeral CLI flows. (#20556, #7464) Thanks @FuzzyTG and @henrybottter.
- Providers/Copilot: drop persisted assistant `thinking` blocks for Claude models (while preserving turn structure/tool blocks) so follow-up requests no longer fail on invalid `thinkingSignature` payloads. (#19459) Thanks @jackheuberger.
- Providers/Copilot: add `claude-sonnet-4.6` and `claude-sonnet-4.5` to the default GitHub Copilot model catalog and add coverage for model-list/definition helpers. (#20270, fixes #20091) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Auto-reply/WebChat: avoid defaulting inbound runtime channel labels to unrelated providers (for example `whatsapp`) for webchat sessions so channel-specific formatting guidance stays accurate. (#21534) Thanks @lbo728.
- Status: include persisted `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` in session summaries so compact `/status` output consistently shows cache hit percentages from real session data.
- Sessions/Usage: persist `totalTokens` from `promptTokens` snapshots even when providers omit structured usage payloads, so session history/status no longer regress to `unknown` token utilization for otherwise successful runs. (#21819) Thanks @zymclaw.
- Heartbeat/Cron: restore interval heartbeat behavior so missing `HEARTBEAT.md` no longer suppresses runs (only effectively empty files skip), preserving prompt-driven and tagged-cron execution paths.
- WhatsApp/Cron/Heartbeat: enforce allowlisted routing for implicit scheduled/system delivery by merging pairing-store + configured `allowFrom` recipients, selecting authorized recipients when last-route context points to a non-allowlisted chat, and preventing heartbeat fan-out to recent unauthorized chats.
- Heartbeat/Active hours: constrain active-hours `24` sentinel parsing to `24:00` in time validation so invalid values like `24:30` are rejected early. (#21410) thanks @adhitShet.
- Heartbeat: treat `activeHours` windows with identical `start`/`end` times as zero-width (always outside the window) instead of always-active. (#21408) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Pairing: default `pairing list` and `pairing approve` to the sole available pairing channel when omitted, so TUI-only setups can recover from `pairing required` without guessing channel arguments. (#21527) Thanks @losts1.
- TUI/Pairing: show explicit pairing-required recovery guidance after gateway disconnects that return `pairing required`, including approval steps to unblock quickstart TUI hatching on fresh installs. (#21841) Thanks @nicolinux.
- TUI/Input: suppress duplicate backspace events arriving in the same input burst window so SSH sessions no longer delete two characters per backspace press in the composer. (#19318) Thanks @eheimer.
- TUI/Models: scope `models.list` to the configured model allowlist (`agents.defaults.models`) so `/model` picker no longer floods with unrelated catalog entries by default. (#18816) Thanks @fwends.
- TUI/Heartbeat: suppress heartbeat ACK/prompt noise in chat streaming when `showOk` is disabled, while still preserving non-ACK heartbeat alerts in final output. (#20228) Thanks @bhalliburton.
- TUI/History: cap chat-log component growth and prune stale render nodes/references so large default history loads no longer overflow render recursion with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. (#18068) Thanks @JaniJegoroff.
- Memory/QMD: diversify mixed-source search ranking when both session and memory collections are present so session transcript hits no longer crowd out durable memory-file matches in top results. (#19913) Thanks @alextempr.
- Memory/Tools: return explicit `unavailable` warnings/actions from `memory_search` when embedding/provider failures occur (including quota exhaustion), so disabled memory does not look like an empty recall result. (#21894) Thanks @XBS9.
- Session/Startup: require the `/new` and `/reset` greeting path to run Session Startup file-reading instructions before responding, so daily memory startup context is not skipped on fresh-session greetings. (#22338) Thanks @armstrong-pv.
- Auth/Onboarding: align OAuth profile-id config mapping with stored credential IDs for OpenAI Codex and Chutes flows, preventing `provider:default` mismatches when OAuth returns email-scoped credentials. (#12692) thanks @mudrii.
- Provider/HTTP: treat HTTP 503 as failover-eligible for LLM provider errors. (#21086) Thanks @Protocol-zero-0.
- Slack: pass `recipient_team_id` / `recipient_user_id` through Slack native streaming calls so `chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream` work reliably across DMs and Slack Connect setups, and disable block streaming when native streaming is active. (#20988) Thanks @Dithilli. Earlier recipient-ID groundwork was contributed in #20377 by @AsserAl1012.
- CLI/Config: add canonical `--strict-json` parsing for `config set` and keep `--json` as a legacy alias to reduce help/behavior drift. (#21332) thanks @adhitShet.
- CLI/Config: preserve explicitly unset config paths in persisted JSON after writes so `openclaw config unset <path>` no longer re-introduces defaulted keys (for example `commands.ownerDisplay`) through schema normalization. (#22984) Thanks @aronchick.
- CLI: keep `openclaw -v` as a root-only version alias so subcommand `-v, --verbose` flags (for example ACP/hooks/skills) are no longer intercepted globally. (#21303) thanks @adhitShet.
- Memory: return empty snippets when `memory_get`/QMD read files that have not been created yet, and harden memory indexing/session helpers against ENOENT races so missing Markdown no longer crashes tools. (#20680) Thanks @pahdo.
- Telegram/Streaming: always clean up draft previews even when dispatch throws before fallback handling, preventing orphaned preview messages during failed runs. (#19041) thanks @mudrii.
- Telegram/Streaming: split reasoning and answer draft preview lanes to prevent cross-lane overwrites, and ignore literal `<think>` tags inside inline/fenced code snippets so sample markup is not misrouted as reasoning. (#20774) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Streaming: restore 30-char first-preview debounce and scope `NO_REPLY` prefix suppression to partial sentinel fragments so normal `No...` text is not filtered. (#22613) thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Status reactions: refresh stall timers on repeated phase updates and honor ack-reaction scope when lifecycle reactions are enabled, preventing false stall emojis and unwanted group reactions. Thanks @wolly-tundracube and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Telegram/Status reactions: keep lifecycle reactions active when available-reactions lookup fails by falling back to unrestricted variant selection instead of suppressing reaction updates. (#22380) thanks @obviyus.
- Discord/Events: await `DiscordMessageListener` message handlers so regular `MESSAGE_CREATE` traffic is processed through queue ordering/timeout flow instead of fire-and-forget drops. (#22396) Thanks @sIlENtbuffER.
- Discord/Streaming: apply `replyToMode: first` only to the first Discord chunk so block-streamed replies do not spam mention pings. (#20726) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow for the report.
- Discord/Components: map DM channel targets back to user-scoped component sessions so button/select interactions stay in the main DM session. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord/Allowlist: lazy-load guild lists when resolving Discord user allowlists so ID-only entries resolve even if guild fetch fails. (#20208) Thanks @zhangjunmengyang.
- Discord/Gateway: handle close code 4014 (missing privileged gateway intents) without crashing the gateway. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: ingest inbound stickers as media so sticker-only messages and forwarded stickers are visible to agents. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Runner: emit `onAgentRunStart` only after agent lifecycle or tool activity begins (and only once per run), so fallback preflight errors no longer mark runs as started. (#21165) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Auto-reply/Tool results: serialize tool-result delivery and keep the delivery chain progressing after individual failures so concurrent tool outputs preserve user-visible ordering. (#21231) thanks @ahdernasr.
- Auto-reply/Prompt caching: restore prefix-cache stability by keeping inbound system metadata session-stable and moving per-message IDs (`message_id`, `message_id_full`, `reply_to_id`, `sender_id`) into untrusted conversation context. (#20597) Thanks @anisoptera.
- iOS/Watch: add actionable watch approval/reject controls and quick-reply actions so watch-originated approvals and responses can be sent directly from notification flows. (#21996) Thanks @mbelinky.

- iOS/Gateway/Tools: prefer uniquely connected node matches when duplicate display names exist, surface actionable `nodes invoke` pairing-required guidance with request IDs, and refresh active iOS gateway registration after location-capability setting changes so capability updates apply immediately. (#22120) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: require `gateway.trustedProxies` to include a loopback proxy address when `auth.mode="trusted-proxy"` and `bind="loopback"`, preventing same-host proxy misconfiguration from silently blocking auth. (#22082, follow-up to #20097) thanks @mbelinky.
- Gateway/Auth: allow trusted-proxy mode with loopback bind for same-host reverse-proxy deployments, while still requiring configured `gateway.trustedProxies`. (#20097) thanks @xinhuagu.
- Gateway/Auth: allow authenticated clients across roles/scopes to call `health` while preserving role and scope enforcement for non-health methods. (#19699) thanks @Nachx639.

- Cron: honor `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` in the timer loop so due jobs can execute up to the configured parallelism instead of always running serially. (#11595) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Agents/Compaction: restore embedded compaction safeguard/context-pruning extension loading in production by wiring bundled extension factories into the resource loader instead of runtime file-path resolution. (#22349) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Agents/Subagents: restore announce-chain delivery to agent injection, defer nested announce output until descendant follow-up content is ready, and prevent descendant deferrals from consuming announce retry budget so deep chains do not drop final completions. (#22223) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/System Prompt: label allowlisted senders as authorized senders to avoid implying ownership. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Agents/Tool display: fix exec cwd suffix inference so `pushd ... && popd ... && <command>` does not keep stale `(in <dir>)` context in summaries. (#21925) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Agents/Google: flatten residual nested `anyOf`/`oneOf` unions in Gemini tool-schema cleanup so Cloud Code Assist no longer rejects unsupported union keywords that survive earlier simplification. (#22825) Thanks @Oceanswave.

- Agents/Failover: treat non-default override runs as direct fallback-to-configured-primary (skip configured fallback chain), normalize default-model detection for provider casing/whitespace, and add regression coverage for override/auth error paths. (#18820) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Docker/Build: include `ownerDisplay` in `CommandsSchema` object-level defaults so Docker `pnpm build` no longer fails with `TS2769` during plugin SDK d.ts generation. (#22558) Thanks @obviyus.
- Docker/Browser: install Playwright Chromium into `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright` and set `node:node` ownership so browser binaries are available to the runtime user in browser-enabled images. (#22585) thanks @obviyus.
- Hooks/Session memory: trigger bundled `session-memory` persistence on both `/new` and `/reset` so reset flows no longer skip markdown transcript capture before archival. (#21382) Thanks @mofesolapaul.
- Dependencies/Agents: bump embedded Pi SDK packages (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`) to `0.54.0`. (#21578) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Config/Agents: expose Pi compaction tuning values `agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokens` and `agents.defaults.compaction.keepRecentTokens` in config schema/types and apply them in embedded Pi runner settings overrides with floor enforcement via `reserveTokensFloor`. (#21568) Thanks @Takhoffman.
- Docker: pin base images to SHA256 digests in Docker builds to prevent mutable tag drift. (#7734) Thanks @coygeek.

- Skills/SonosCLI: add troubleshooting guidance for `sonos discover` failures on macOS direct mode (`sendto: no route to host`) and sandbox network restrictions (`bind: operation not permitted`). (#21316) Thanks @huntharo.
- macOS/Build: default release packaging to `BUNDLE_ID=ai.openclaw.mac` in `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh`, so Sparkle feed URL is retained and auto-update no longer fails with an empty appcast feed. (#19750) thanks @loganprit.
- Signal/Outbound: preserve case for Base64 group IDs during outbound target normalization so cross-context routing and policy checks no longer break when group IDs include uppercase characters. (#5578) Thanks @heyhudson.
- Anthropic/Agents: preserve required pi-ai default OAuth beta headers when `context1m` injects `anthropic-beta`, preventing 401 auth failures for `sk-ant-oat-*` tokens. (#19789, fixes #19769) Thanks @minupla.

Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- WhatsApp/Security: enforce allowlist JID authorization for reaction actions so authenticated callers cannot target non-allowlisted chats by forging `chatJid` + valid `messageId` pairs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- ACP/Security: escape control and delimiter characters in ACP `resource_link` title/URI metadata before prompt interpolation to prevent metadata-driven prompt injection through resource links. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- TTS/Security: make model-driven provider switching opt-in by default (`messages.tts.modelOverrides.allowProvider=false` unless explicitly enabled), while keeping voice/style overrides available, to reduce prompt-injection-driven provider hops and unexpected TTS cost escalation. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Agents: keep overflow compaction retry budgeting global across tool-result truncation recovery so successful truncation cannot reset the overflow retry counter and amplify retry/cost cycles. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- BlueBubbles/Security: require webhook token authentication for all BlueBubbles webhook requests (including loopback/proxied setups), removing passwordless webhook fallback behavior. Thanks @zpbrent.

- Security/Sandbox: remove default `--no-sandbox` for the browser container entrypoint, add explicit opt-in via `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX` / `CLAWDBOT_BROWSER_NO_SANDBOX`, and add security-audit checks for stale/missing sandbox browser Docker hash labels. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee and @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: require VNC password auth for noVNC observer sessions in the sandbox browser entrypoint, plumb per-container noVNC passwords from runtime, and emit short-lived noVNC observer token URLs while keeping loopback-only host port publishing. Thanks @TerminalsandCoffee for reporting.
- Security/Sandbox Browser: default browser sandbox containers to a dedicated Docker network (`openclaw-sandbox-browser`), add optional CDP ingress source-range restrictions, auto-create missing dedicated networks, and warn in `openclaw security --audit` when browser sandboxing runs on bridge without source-range limits.

- Dev tooling: align `oxfmt` local/CI formatting behavior. (#12579) Thanks @vincentkoc.

### Fixes

- Security: strip hidden text from `web_fetch` extracted content to prevent indirect prompt injection, covering CSS-hidden elements, class-based hiding (sr-only, d-none, etc.), invisible Unicode, color:transparent, offscreen transforms, and non-content tags. (#8027, #21074) Thanks @hydro13 for the fix and @LucasAIBuilder for reporting.
- Agents/Streaming: keep assistant partial streaming active during reasoning streams, handle native `thinking_*` stream events consistently, dedupe mixed reasoning-end signals, and clear stale mutating tool errors after same-target retry success. (#20635) Thanks @obviyus.
- iOS/Chat: use a dedicated iOS chat session key for ChatSheet routing to avoid cross-client session collisions with main-session traffic. (#21139) thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: auto-resync chat history after reconnect sequence gaps, clear stale pending runs, and avoid dead-end manual refresh errors after transient disconnects. (#21135) thanks @mbelinky.
- UI/Usage: reload usage data immediately when timezone changes so Local/UTC toggles apply the selected date range without requiring a manual refresh. (#17774)
- iOS/Screen: move `WKWebView` lifecycle ownership into `ScreenWebView` coordinator and explicit attach/detach flow to reduce gesture/lifecycle crash risk (`__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:` paths) during screen tab updates. (#20366) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Onboarding: prevent pairing-status flicker during auto-resume by keeping resumed state transitions stable. (#20310) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Onboarding: stabilize pairing and reconnect behavior by resetting stale pairing request state on manual retry, disconnecting both operator and node gateways on operator failure, and avoiding duplicate pairing loops from operator transport identity attachment. (#20056) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Signing: restore local auto-selected signing-team overrides during iOS project generation by wiring `.local-signing.xcconfig` into the active signing config and emitting `OPENCLAW_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in local signing setup. (#19993) Thanks @ngutman.
- Telegram: unify message-like inbound handling so `message` and `channel_post` share the same dedupe/access/media pipeline and remain behaviorally consistent. (#20591) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: keep media-group processing resilient by skipping recoverable per-item download failures while still failing loud on non-recoverable media errors. (#20598) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram/Agents: gate exec/bash tool-failure warnings behind verbose mode so default Telegram replies stay clean while verbose sessions still surface diagnostics. (#20560) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram/Cron/Heartbeat: honor explicit Telegram topic targets in cron and heartbeat delivery (`<chatId>:topic:<threadId>`) so scheduled sends land in the configured topic instead of the last active thread. (#19367) Thanks @Lukavyi.
- Telegram/DM routing: prevent DM inbound origin metadata from leaking into main-session `lastRoute` updates and normalize DM `lastRoute.to` to provider-prefixed `telegram:<chatId>`. (#19491) thanks @guirguispierre.
- Gateway/Daemon: forward `TMPDIR` into installed service environments so macOS LaunchAgent gateway runs can open SQLite temp/journal files reliably instead of failing with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN`. (#20512) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Agents/Billing: include the active model that produced a billing error in user-facing billing messages (for example, `OpenAI (gpt-5.3)`) across payload, failover, and lifecycle error paths, so users can identify exactly which key needs credits. (#20510) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/TUI: honor `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` for `chat.send` by removing the hardcoded block-streaming disable override, so replies can use configured block-mode delivery. (#19693) Thanks @neipor.

- Canvas/A2UI: improve bundled-asset resolution and empty-state handling so UI fallbacks render reliably. (#20312) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Commands/Doctor: avoid rewriting invalid configs with new `gateway.auth.token` defaults during repair and only write when real config changes are detected, preventing accidental token duplication and backup churn.
- Gateway/Auth: default unresolved gateway auth to token mode with startup auto-generation/persistence of `gateway.auth.token`, while allowing explicit `gateway.auth.mode: "none"` for intentional open loopback setups. (#20686) thanks @gumadeiras.

- Gateway: clarify launchctl GUI domain bootstrap failure on macOS. (#13795) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Lobster/CI: fix flaky test Windows cmd shim script resolution. (#20833) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Browser/Relay: require gateway-token auth on both `/extension` and `/cdp`, and align Chrome extension setup to use a single `gateway.auth.token` input for relay authentication. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Gateway/Hooks: run BOOT.md startup checks per configured agent scope, including per-agent session-key resolution, startup-hook regression coverage, and non-success boot outcome logging for diagnosability. (#20569) thanks @mcaxtr.
- Protocol/Apple: regenerate Swift gateway models for `push.test` so `pnpm protocol:check` stays green on main. Thanks @mbelinky.
- Sandbox/Registry: serialize container and browser registry writes with shared file locks and atomic replacement to prevent lost updates and delete rollback races from desyncing `sandbox list`, `prune`, and `recreate --all`. Thanks @kexinoh.
- OTEL/diagnostics-otel: complete OpenTelemetry v2 API migration. (#12897) Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Security/Windows Daemon: harden Scheduled Task `gateway.cmd` generation by quoting cmd metacharacter arguments, escaping `%`/`!` expansions, and rejecting CR/LF in arguments, descriptions, and environment assignments (`set "KEY=VALUE"`), preventing command injection in Windows daemon startup scripts. Thanks @tdjackey for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Canvas: replace shared-IP fallback auth with node-scoped session capability URLs for `/__openclaw__/canvas/*` and `/__openclaw__/a2ui/*`, fail closed when trusted-proxy requests omit forwarded client headers, and add IPv6/proxy-header regression coverage. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Net: enforce strict dotted-decimal IPv4 literals in SSRF checks and fail closed on unsupported legacy forms (octal/hex/short/packed, for example `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1`, `2130706433`) before DNS lookup.
- Security/Discord: enforce trusted-sender guild permission checks for moderation actions (`timeout`, `kick`, `ban`) and ignore untrusted `senderUserId` params to prevent privilege escalation in tool-driven flows. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.

- Security/Plugins/Hooks: enforce runtime/package path containment with realpath checks so `openclaw.extensions`, `openclaw.hooks`, and hook handler modules cannot escape their trusted roots via traversal or symlinks.
- Security/Discord: centralize trusted sender checks for moderation actions in message-action dispatch, share moderation command parsing across handlers, and clarify permission helpers with explicit any/all semantics.
- Security/ACP: harden ACP bridge session management with duplicate-session refresh, idle-session reaping, oldest-idle soft-cap eviction, and burst rate limiting on session creation to reduce local DoS risk without disrupting normal IDE usage.
- Security/ACP: bound ACP prompt text payloads to 2 MiB before gateway forwarding, account for join separator bytes during pre-concatenation size checks, and avoid stale active-run session state when oversized prompts are rejected. Thanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: add optional `--pin` for npm plugin/hook installs, persist resolved npm metadata (`name`, `version`, `spec`, integrity, shasum, timestamp), warn/confirm on integrity drift during updates, and extend `openclaw security audit` to flag unpinned specs, missing integrity metadata, and install-record version drift.
- Security/Plugins: harden plugin discovery by blocking unsafe candidates (root escapes, world-writable paths, suspicious ownership), add startup warnings when `plugins.allow` is empty with discoverable non-bundled plugins, and warn on loaded plugins without install/load-path provenance.
- Security/Gateway: rate-limit control-plane write RPCs (`config.apply`, `config.patch`, `update.run`) to 3 requests per minute per `deviceId+clientIp`, add restart single-flight coalescing plus a 30-second restart cooldown, and log actor/device/ip with changed-path audit details for config/update-triggered restarts.
- Security/Webhooks: harden Feishu and Zalo webhook ingress with webhook-mode token preconditions, loopback-default Feishu bind host, JSON content-type enforcement, per-path rate limiting, replay dedupe for Zalo events, constant-time Zalo secret comparison, and anomaly status counters.

Thanks @allsmog for reporting.
- Security/Exec: require `tools.exec.safeBins` binaries to resolve from trusted bin directories (system defaults plus gateway startup `PATH`) so PATH-hijacked trojan binaries cannot bypass allowlist checks. Thanks @jackhax for reporting.
- Security/Exec: remove file-existence oracle behavior from `tools.exec.safeBins` by using deterministic argv-only stdin-safe validation and blocking file-oriented flags (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`) so allow/deny results no longer disclose host file presence. Thanks @nedlir for reporting.

Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
- Security/Exec: block grep safe-bin positional operand bypass by setting grep positional budget to zero, so `-e/--regexp` cannot smuggle bare filename reads (for example `.env`) via ambiguous positionals; safe-bin grep patterns must come from `-e/--regexp`. Thanks @athuljayaram for reporting.
- Security/Gateway/Agents: remove implicit admin scopes from agent tool gateway calls by classifying methods to least-privilege operator scopes, and enforce owner-only tooling (`cron`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) through centralized tool-policy wrappers plus tool metadata to prevent non-owner DM privilege escalation. Ships in the next npm release. Thanks @Adam55A-code for reporting.

## 2026.2.17

### Changes

- Agents/Anthropic: add opt-in 1M context beta header support for Opus/Sonnet via model `params.context1m: true` (maps to `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07`).
- Agents/Models: support Anthropic Sonnet 4.6 (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`) across aliases/defaults with forward-compat fallback when upstream catalogs still only expose Sonnet 4.5.
- Commands/Subagents: add `/subagents spawn` for deterministic subagent activation from chat commands. (#18218) Thanks @JoshuaLelon.
- Agents/Subagents: add an accepted response note for `sessions_spawn` explaining polling subagents are disabled for one-off calls. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents: prefix spawned subagent task messages with context to preserve source information in downstream handling. Thanks @tyler6204.
- iOS/Share: add an iOS share extension that forwards shared URL/text/image content directly to gateway `agent.request`, with delivery-route fallback and optional receipt acknowledgements. (#19424) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Talk: add a `Background Listening` toggle that keeps Talk Mode active while the app is backgrounded (off by default for battery safety). Thanks @zeulewan.
- iOS/Talk: add a `Voice Directive Hint` toggle for Talk Mode prompts so users can disable ElevenLabs voice-switching instructions to save tokens when not needed. (#18250) Thanks @zeulewan.
- iOS/Talk: harden barge-in behavior by disabling interrupt-on-speech when output route is built-in speaker/receiver, reducing false interruptions from local TTS bleed-through. Thanks @zeulewan.
- Slack: add native single-message text streaming with Slack `chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream`; keep reply threading aligned with `replyToMode`, default streaming to enabled, and fall back to normal delivery when streaming fails. (#9972) Thanks @natedenh.
- Slack: add configurable streaming modes for draft previews. (#18555) Thanks @Solvely-Colin.
- Telegram/Agents: add inline button `style` support (`primary|success|danger`) across message tool schema, Telegram action parsing, send pipeline, and runtime prompt guidance. (#18241) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: surface user message reactions as system events, with configurable `channels.telegram.reactionNotifications` scope. (#10075) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- iMessage: support `replyToId` on outbound text/media sends and normalize leading `[[reply_to:<id>]]` tags so replies target the intended iMessage. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Tool Display/Web UI: add intent-first tool detail views and exec summaries. (#18592) Thanks @xdLawless2.
- Discord: expose native `/exec` command options (host/security/ask/node) so Discord slash commands get autocomplete and structured inputs. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: allow reusable interactive components with `components.reusable=true` so buttons, selects, and forms can be used multiple times before expiring. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: add per-button `allowedUsers` allowlist for interactive components to restrict who can click buttons. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Gateway: separate per-job webhook delivery (`delivery.mode = "webhook"`) from announce delivery, enforce valid HTTP(S) webhook URLs, and keep a temporary legacy `notify + cron.webhook` fallback for stored jobs. (#17901) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Cron/CLI: add deterministic default stagger for recurring top-of-hour cron schedules (including 6-field seconds cron), auto-migrate existing jobs to persisted `schedule.staggerMs`, and add `openclaw cron add/edit --stagger <duration>` plus `--exact` overrides for per-job timing control.
- Cron: log per-run model/provider usage telemetry in cron run logs/webhooks and add a local usage report script for aggregating token usage by job. (#18172) Thanks @HankAndTheCrew.
- Tools/Web: add URL allowlists for `web_search` and `web_fetch`. (#18584) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Browser: add `extraArgs` config for custom Chrome launch arguments. (#18443) Thanks @JayMishra-source.

- Skills: refine skill-description routing boundaries with explicit "Use when"/"NOT for" guidance for coding-agent/github/weather, and clarify PTY/browser fallback wording. (#14577) Thanks @DylanWoodAkers.
- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id` in conversation metadata payloads for downstream targeting workflows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Auto-reply: include `sender_id` in trusted inbound metadata so moderation workflows can target the sender without relying on untrusted text. (#18303) Thanks @crimeacs.
- UI/Sessions: avoid duplicating typed session prefixes in display names (for example `Subagent Subagent ...`). Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Z.AI: enable `tool_stream` by default for real-time tool call streaming, with opt-out via `params.tool_stream: false`. (#18173) Thanks @tianxiao1430-jpg.
- Plugins: add `before_agent_start` model/provider overrides before resolution. (#18568) Thanks @natefikru.
- Mattermost: add emoji reaction actions plus reaction event notifications, including an explicit boolean `remove` flag to avoid accidental removals. (#18608) Thanks @echo931.

- Docker: add optional `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_BROWSER` build arg to preinstall Chromium + Xvfb in the Docker image, avoiding runtime Playwright installs. (#18449)

### Fixes

- Agents/Antigravity: preserve unsigned Claude thinking blocks as plain text instead of dropping them during transcript sanitization, preventing reasoning context loss while avoiding `thinking.signature` request rejections.
- Agents/Google: clean tool JSON Schemas for `google-antigravity` the same as `google-gemini-cli` before Cloud Code Assist requests, preventing Claude tool calls from failing with `patternProperties` 400 errors. (#19860)
- Tests/Telegram: add regression coverage for command-menu sync that asserts all `setMyCommands` entries are Telegram-safe and hyphen-normalized across native/custom/plugin command sources. (#19703) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image: collapse resize diagnostics to one line per image and include visible pixel/byte size details in the log message for faster triage.
- Auth/Cooldowns: clear all usage stats fields (`disabledUntil`, `disabledReason`, `failureCounts`) in `clearAuthProfileCooldown` so manual cooldown resets fully recover billing-disabled profiles without requiring direct file edits. (#19211) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents/Subagents: preemptively guard accumulated tool-result context before model calls by truncating oversized outputs and compacting oldest tool-result messages to avoid context-window overflow crashes. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents/CLI: fail `sessions_spawn` when subagent model patching is rejected, allow subagent model patch defaults from `subagents.model`, and keep `sessions list`/`status` model reporting aligned to runtime model resolution. (#18660) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents/Subagents: add explicit subagent guidance to recover from `[compacted: tool output removed to free context]` / `[truncated: output exceeded context limit]` markers by re-reading with smaller chunks instead of full-file `cat`. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: make `read` auto-page across chunks (when no explicit `limit` is provided) and scale its per-call output budget from model `contextWindow`, so larger contexts can read more before context guards kick in. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: strip duplicated `read` truncation payloads from tool-result `details` and make pre-call context guarding account for heavy tool-result metadata, so repeated `read` calls no longer bypass compaction and overflow model context windows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Reply threading: keep reply context sticky across streamed/split chunks and preserve `replyToId` on all chunk sends across shared and channel-specific delivery paths (including iMessage, BlueBubbles, Telegram, Discord, and Matrix), so follow-up bubbles stay attached to the same referenced message. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Agent: defer transient lifecycle `error` snapshots with a short grace window so `agent.wait` does not resolve early during retry/failover. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Presence: centralize presence snapshot broadcasts and unify runtime version precedence (`OPENCLAW_VERSION` > `OPENCLAW_SERVICE_VERSION` > `npm_package_version`) so self-presence and websocket `hello-ok` report consistent versions.
- Hooks/Automation: bridge outbound/inbound message lifecycle into internal hook events (`message:received`, `message:sent`) with session-key correlation guards, while keeping per-payload success/error reporting accurate for chunked and best-effort deliveries. (PR #9387)
- Media understanding: honor `agents.defaults.imageModel` during auto-discovery so implicit image analysis uses configured primary/fallback image models. (PR #7607)
- iOS/Onboarding: stop auth Step 3 retry-loop churn by pausing reconnect attempts on unauthorized/missing-token gateway errors and keeping auth/pairing issue state sticky during manual retry. (#19153) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Voice-call: auto-end calls when media streams disconnect to prevent stuck active calls. (#18435) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Voice call/Gateway: prevent overlapping closed-loop turn races with per-call turn locking, route transcript dedupe via source-aware fingerprints with strict cache eviction bounds, and harden `voicecall latency` stats for large logs without spread-operator stack overflow. (#19140) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: route ChatSheet RPCs through the operator session instead of the node session to avoid node-role authorization failures for `chat.history`, `chat.send`, and `sessions.list`. (#19320) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Update: correct the Sparkle appcast version for 2026.2.15 so updates are offered again. (#18201)

- BlueBubbles: match outbound message-id fallback recovery by chat identifier as well as account context. Thanks @tyler6204.
- BlueBubbles: include sender identifier in untrusted conversation metadata for conversation info payloads. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Security/Exec: fix the OC-09 credential-theft path via environment-variable injection. (#18048) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Config: confine `$include` resolution to the top-level config directory, harden traversal/symlink checks with cross-platform-safe path containment, and add doctor hints for invalid escaped include paths. (#18652) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Net: block SSRF bypass via ISATAP embedded IPv4 transition addresses and centralize hostname/IP blocking checks across URL safety validators. Thanks @zpbrent for reporting.
- Providers: improve error messaging for unconfigured local `ollama`/`vllm` providers. (#18183) Thanks @arosstale.
- TTS: surface all provider errors instead of only the last error in aggregated failures. (#17964) Thanks @ikari-pl.

- Fix types in all tests. Typecheck the whole repository.
- Gateway/Channels: wire `gateway.channelHealthCheckMinutes` into strict config validation, treat implicit account status as managed for health checks, and harden channel auto-restart flow (preserve restart-attempt caps across crash loops, propagate enabled/configured runtime flags, and stop pending restart backoff after manual stop). Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/WebChat: hard-cap `chat.history` oversized payloads by truncating high-cost fields and replacing over-budget entries with placeholders, so history fetches stay within configured byte limits and avoid chat UI freezes. (#18505)
- UI/Usage: replace lingering undefined `var(--text-muted)` usage with `var(--muted)` in usage date-range and chart styles to keep muted text visible across themes. (#17975) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Usage: preserve selected-range totals when timeline data is downsampled by bucket-aggregating timeseries points (instead of dropping intermediate points), so filtered tokens/cost stay accurate. (#17959) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Sessions: refresh the sessions table only after successful deletes and preserve delete errors on cancel/failure paths, so deleted sessions disappear automatically without masking delete failures. (#18507)
- Scripts/UI/Windows: fix `pnpm ui:*` spawn `EINVAL` failures by restoring shell-backed launch for `.cmd`/`.bat` runners, narrowing shell usage to launcher types that require it, and rejecting unsafe forwarded shell metacharacters in UI script args. (#18594)
- Hooks/Session-memory: recover `/new` conversation summaries when session pointers are reset-path or missing `sessionFile`, and consistently prefer the newest `.jsonl.reset.*` transcript candidate for fallback extraction. (#18088)
- Auto-reply/Sessions: prevent stale thread ID leakage into non-thread sessions so replies stay in the main DM after topic interactions. (#18528) Thanks @j2h4u.
- Slack: restrict forwarded-attachment ingestion to explicit shared-message attachments and skip non-Slack forwarded `image_url` fetches, preventing non-forward attachment unfurls from polluting inbound agent context while preserving forwarded message handling.
- Feishu: detect bot mentions in post messages with embedded docs when `message.mentions` is empty. (#18074) Thanks @popomore.
- Agents/Sessions: align session lock watchdog hold windows with run and compaction timeout budgets (plus grace), preventing valid long-running turns from being force-unlocked mid-run while still recovering hung lock owners. (#18060)
- Cron: preserve default model fallbacks for cron agent runs when only `model.primary` is overridden, so failover still follows configured fallbacks unless explicitly cleared with `fallbacks: []`. (#18210) Thanks @mahsumaktas.
- Cron: route text-only announce output through the main session announce flow via runSubagentAnnounceFlow so cron text-only output remains visible to the initiating session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron: treat `timeoutSeconds: 0` as no-timeout (not clamped to 1), ensuring long-running cron runs are not prematurely terminated. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron announce injection now targets the session determined by delivery config (`to` + channel) instead of defaulting to the current session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron/Heartbeat: canonicalize session-scoped reminder `sessionKey` routing and preserve explicit flat `sessionKey` cron tool inputs, preventing enqueue/wake namespace drift for session-targeted reminders. (#18637) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Cron/Webhooks: reuse existing session IDs for webhook/cron runs when the session key is stable and still fresh, preserving conversation history. (#18031) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Cron: prevent spin loops when cron jobs complete within the scheduled second by advancing the next run and enforcing a minimum refire gap. (#18073) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.

- iOS/Talk: harden mobile talk config handling by ignoring redacted/env-placeholder API keys, support secure local keychain override, improve accessibility motion/contrast behavior in status UI, and tighten ATS to local-network allowance. (#18163) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Location: restore the significant location monitor implementation (service hooks + protocol surface + ATS key alignment) after merge drift so iOS builds compile again. (#18260) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Signing: auto-select local Apple Development team during iOS project generation/build, prefer the canonical OpenClaw team when available, and support local per-machine signing overrides without committing team IDs. (#18421) Thanks @ngutman.
- Discord/Telegram: make per-account message action gates effective for both action listing and execution, and preserve top-level gate restrictions when account overrides only specify a subset of `actions` keys (account key -> base key -> default fallback). (#18494)
- Telegram: keep DM-topic replies and draft previews in the originating private-chat topic by preserving positive `message_thread_id` values for DM threads. (#18586) Thanks @sebslight.
- Telegram: preserve private-chat topic `message_thread_id` on outbound sends (message/sticker/poll), keep thread-not-found retry fallback, and avoid masking `chat not found` routing errors. (#18993) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: prevent duplicate media delivery when the model uses the `message send` tool with media, by skipping media extraction from messaging tool results since the tool already sent the message directly. (#18270)
- Discord: route `audioAsVoice` auto-replies through the voice message API so opt-in audio renders as voice messages. (#18041) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Discord: skip auto-thread creation in forum/media/voice/stage channels and keep group session last-route metadata fresh to avoid invalid thread API errors and lost follow-up sends. (#18098) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Discord/Commands: normalize `commands.allowFrom` entries with `user:`/`discord:`/`pk:` prefixes and `<@id>` mentions so command authorization matches Discord allowlist behavior. (#18042)
- Telegram: keep draft-stream preview replies attached to the user message for `replyToMode: "all"` in groups and DMs, preserving threaded reply context from preview through finalization. (#17880) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: prevent streaming final replies from being overwritten by later final/error payloads, and suppress fallback tool-error warnings when a recovered assistant answer already exists after tool calls. (#17883) Thanks @Marvae and @obviyus.
- Telegram: debounce the first draft-stream preview update (30-char threshold) and finalize short responses by editing the stop-time preview message, improving first push notifications and avoiding duplicate final sends. (#18148) Thanks @Marvae.
- Telegram: disable block streaming when `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `off`, preventing newline/content-block replies from splitting into multiple messages. (#17679) Thanks @saivarunk.
- Telegram: keep `streamMode: "partial"` draft previews in a single message across assistant-message/reasoning boundaries, preventing duplicate preview bubbles during partial-mode tool-call turns. (#18956) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: normalize native command names for Telegram menu registration (`-` -> `_`) to avoid `BOT_COMMAND_INVALID` command-menu wipeouts, and log failed command syncs instead of silently swallowing them. (#19257) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Telegram: route non-abort slash commands on the normal chat/topic sequential lane while keeping true abort requests (`/stop`, `stop`) on the control lane, preventing command/reply race conditions from control-lane bypass. (#17899) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: ignore `<media:...>` placeholder lines when extracting `MEDIA:` tool-result paths, preventing false local-file reads and dropped replies. (#18510) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: skip retries when inbound media `getFile` fails with Telegram's 20MB limit and continue processing message text, avoiding dropped messages for oversized attachments. (#18531) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Telegram: clear stored polling offsets when bot tokens change or accounts are deleted, preventing stale offsets after token rotations. (#18233)
- Telegram: enable `autoSelectFamily` by default on Node.js 22+ so IPv4 fallback works on broken IPv6 networks. (#18272) Thanks @nacho9900.
- Auto-reply/TTS: keep tool-result media delivery enabled in group chats and native command sessions (while still suppressing tool summary text) so `NO_REPLY` follow-ups do not drop successful TTS audio. (#17991) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/Tools: deliver tool-result media even when verbose tool output is off so media attachments are not dropped. (#16679)
- Discord: optimize reaction notification handling to skip unnecessary message fetches in `off`/`all`/`allowlist` modes, streamline reaction routing, and improve reaction emoji formatting. (#18248) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow and @victorGPT.
- CLI/Pairing: make `openclaw qr --remote` prefer `gateway.remote.url` over tailscale/public URL resolution and register the `openclaw clawbot qr` legacy alias path. (#18091)
- CLI/QR: restore fail-fast validation for `openclaw qr --remote` when neither `gateway.remote.url` nor tailscale `serve`/`funnel` is configured, preventing unusable remote pairing QR flows. (#18166) Thanks @mbelinky.
- CLI: fix parent/subcommand option collisions across gateway, daemon, update, ACP, and browser command flows, while preserving legacy `browser set headers --json <payload>` compatibility.
- CLI/Doctor: ensure `openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive --yes` exits promptly after completion so one-shot automation no longer hangs. (#18502)
- CLI/Doctor: auto-repair `dmPolicy="open"` configs missing wildcard allowlists and write channel-correct repair paths (including `channels.googlechat.dm.allowFrom`) so `openclaw doctor --fix` no longer leaves Google Chat configs invalid after attempted repair. (#18544)
- CLI/Doctor: detect gateway service token drift when the gateway token is only provided via environment variables, keeping service repairs aligned after token rotation.
- Gateway/Update: prevent restart crash loops after failed self-updates by restarting only on successful updates, stopping early on failed install/build steps, and running `openclaw doctor --fix` during updates to sanitize config. (#18131) Thanks @RamiNoodle733.
- Gateway/Update: preserve update.run restart delivery context so post-update status replies route back to the initiating channel/thread. (#18267) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Update: run a standalone restart helper after updates, honoring service-name overrides and reporting restart initiation separately from confirmed restarts. (#18050)
- CLI/Daemon: warn when a gateway restart sees a stale service token so users can reinstall with `openclaw gateway install --force`, and skip drift warnings for non-gateway service restarts. (#18018)
- CLI/Daemon: prefer the active version-manager Node when installing daemons and include macOS version-manager bin directories in the service PATH so launchd services resolve user-managed runtimes.
- CLI/Status: fix `openclaw status --all` token summaries for bot-token-only channels so Mattermost/Zalo no longer show a bot+app warning. (#18527) Thanks @echo931.
- CLI/Configure: make the `/model picker` allowlist prompt searchable with tokenized matching in `openclaw configure` so users can filter huge model lists by typing terms like `gpt-5.2 openai/`. (#19010) Thanks @bjesuiter.
- CLI/Message: preserve `--components` JSON payloads in `openclaw message send` so Discord component payloads are no longer dropped. (#18222) Thanks @saurabhchopade.
- Voice Call: add an optional stale call reaper (`staleCallReaperSeconds`) to end stuck calls when enabled. (#18437)
- Auto-reply/Subagents: propagate group context (`groupId`, `groupChannel`, `space`) when spawning via `/subagents spawn`, matching tool-triggered subagent spawn behavior.
- Subagents: route nested announce results back to the parent session after the parent run ends, falling back only when the parent session is deleted. (#18043) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Subagents: cap announce retry loops with max attempts and expiry to prevent infinite retry spam after deferred announces. (#18444)
- Agents/Tools/exec: add a preflight guard that detects likely shell env var injection (e.g. `$DM_JSON`, `$TMPDIR`) in Python/Node scripts before execution, preventing recurring cron failures and wasted tokens when models emit mixed shell+language source. (#12836)
- Agents/Tools/exec: treat normal non-zero exit codes as completed and append the exit code to tool output to avoid false tool-failure warnings. (#18425)
- Agents/Tools: make loop detection progress-aware and phased by hard-blocking known `process(action=poll|log)` no-progress loops, warning on generic identical-call repeats, warning + no-progress-blocking ping-pong alternation loops (10/20), coalescing repeated warning spam into threshold buckets (including canonical ping-pong pairs), adding a global circuit breaker at 30 no-progress repeats, and emitting structured diagnostic `tool.loop` warning/error events for loop actions. (#16808) Thanks @akramcodez and @beca-oc.
- Agents/Hooks: preserve the `before_tool_call` wrapped-marker across abort-signal tool wrapping so the hook runs once per tool call in normal agent sessions. (#16852) Thanks @sreuter.
- Agents/Tests: add `before_message_write` persistence regression coverage for block/mutate behavior (including synthetic tool-result flushes) and thrown-hook fallback persistence. (#18197) Thanks @shakkernerd
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image tool: replace Anthropic-incompatible union schema with explicit `image` (single) and `images` (multi) parameters, keeping tool schemas `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`-free while preserving multi-image analysis support. (#18551, #18566) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Agents/Models: probe the primary model when its auth-profile cooldown is near expiry (with per-provider throttling), so runs recover from temporary rate limits without staying on fallback models until restart. (#17478) Thanks @PlayerGhost.
- Agents/Failover: classify provider abort stop-reason errors (`Unhandled stop reason: abort`, `stop reason: abort`, `reason: abort`) as timeout-class failures so configured model fallback chains trigger instead of surfacing raw abort failures. (#18618) Thanks @sauerdaniel.
- Models/CLI: sync auth-profiles credentials into agent `auth.json` before registry availability checks so `openclaw models list --all` reports auth correctly for API-key/token providers, normalize provider-id aliases when bridging credentials, and skip expired token mirrors. (#18610, #18615)
- Agents/Context: raise default total bootstrap prompt cap from `24000` to `150000` chars (keeping `bootstrapMaxChars` at `20000`), include total-cap visibility in `/context`, and mark truncation from injected-vs-raw sizes so total-cap clipping is reflected accurately.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Cron: preserve per-job schedule-error isolation in post-run maintenance recompute so malformed sibling jobs no longer abort persistence of successful runs. (#17852) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Gateway/Config: prevent `config.patch` object-array merges from falling back to full-array replacement when some patch entries lack `id`, so partial `agents.list` updates no longer drop unrelated agents. (#17989) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Auth: trim whitespace around trusted proxy entries before matching so configured proxies with stray spaces still authorize. (#18084) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Config/Discord: require string IDs in Discord allowlists, keep onboarding inputs string-only, and add doctor repair for numeric entries. (#18220) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Sessions: create new session transcript JSONL files with user-only (`0o600`) permissions and extend `openclaw security audit --fix` to remediate existing transcript file permissions.
- Sessions/Maintenance: archive transcripts when pruning stale sessions, clean expired media in subdirectories, and purge `.deleted` transcript archives after the prune window to prevent disk leaks. (#18538)
- Infra/Fetch: ensure foreign abort-signal listener cleanup never masks original fetch successes/failures, while still preventing detached-finally unhandled rejection noise in `wrapFetchWithAbortSignal`. Thanks @Jackten.
- Heartbeat: allow suppressing tool error warning payloads during heartbeat runs via a new heartbeat config flag. (#18497) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Heartbeat: include sender metadata (From/To/Provider) in heartbeat prompts so model context matches the delivery target. (#18532) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Heartbeat/Telegram: strip configured `responsePrefix` before heartbeat ack detection (with boundary-safe matching) so prefixed `HEARTBEAT_OK` replies are correctly suppressed instead of leaking into DMs. (#18602)

## 2026.2.15

### Changes

- Discord: unlock rich interactive agent prompts with Components v2 (buttons, selects, modals, and attachment-backed file blocks) so for native interaction through Discord. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: components v2 UI + embeds passthrough + exec approval UX refinements (CV2 containers, button layout, Discord-forwarding skip). Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Plugins: expose `llm_input` and `llm_output` hook payloads so extensions can observe prompt/input context and model output usage details. (#16724) Thanks @SecondThread.
- Subagents: nested sub-agents (sub-sub-agents) with configurable depth. Set `agents.defaults.subagents.maxSpawnDepth: 2` to allow sub-agents to spawn their own children. Includes `maxChildrenPerAgent` limit (default 5), depth-aware tool policy, and proper announce chain routing. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Slack/Discord/Telegram: add per-channel ack reaction overrides (account/channel-level) to support platform-specific emoji formats. (#17092) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Telegram: add `channel_post` inbound support for channel-based bot-to-bot wake/trigger flows, with channel allowlist gating and message/media batching parity.
- Cron/Gateway: add finished-run webhook delivery toggle (`notify`) and dedicated webhook auth token support (`cron.webhookToken`) for outbound cron webhook posts. (#14535) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Channels: deduplicate probe/token resolution base types across core + extensions while preserving per-channel error typing. (#16986) Thanks @iyoda and @thewilloftheshadow.
- Memory: add MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) re-ranking for hybrid search diversity. Configurable via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.mmr`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Memory: add opt-in temporal decay for hybrid search scoring, with configurable half-life via `memorySearch.query.hybrid.temporalDecay`. Thanks @rodrigouroz.

### Fixes

- Discord: send initial content when creating non-forum threads so `thread-create` content is delivered. (#18117) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Security: replace deprecated SHA-1 sandbox configuration hashing with SHA-256 for deterministic sandbox cache identity and recreation checks. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Security/Logging: redact Telegram bot tokens from error messages and uncaught stack traces to prevent accidental secret leakage into logs. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox/Security: block dangerous sandbox Docker config (bind mounts, host networking, unconfined seccomp/apparmor) to prevent container escape via config injection. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Sandbox: preserve array order in config hashing so order-sensitive Docker/browser settings trigger container recreation correctly. Thanks @kexinoh.
- Gateway/Security: redact sensitive session/path details from `status` responses for non-admin clients; full details remain available to `operator.admin`. (#8590) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Control UI: preserve requested operator scopes for Control UI bypass modes (`allowInsecureAuth` / `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`) when device identity is unavailable, preventing false `missing scope` failures on authenticated LAN/HTTP operator sessions. (#17682) Thanks @leafbird.
- LINE/Security: fail closed on webhook startup when channel token or channel secret is missing, and treat LINE accounts as configured only when both are present. (#17587) Thanks @davidahmann.
- Skills/Security: restrict `download` installer `targetDir` to the per-skill tools directory to prevent arbitrary file writes. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Skills/Linux: harden go installer fallback on apt-based systems by handling root/no-sudo environments safely, doing best-effort apt index refresh, and returning actionable errors instead of failing with spawn errors. (#17687) Thanks @mcrolly.
- Web Fetch/Security: cap downloaded response body size before HTML parsing to prevent memory exhaustion from oversized or deeply nested pages. Thanks @xuemian168.
- Config/Gateway: make sensitive-key whitelist suffix matching case-insensitive while preserving `passwordFile` path exemptions, preventing accidental redaction of non-secret config values like `maxTokens` and IRC password-file paths. (#16042) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Dev tooling: harden git `pre-commit` hook against option injection from malicious filenames (for example `--force`), preventing accidental staging of ignored files. Thanks @mrthankyou.
- Gateway/Agent: reject malformed `agent:`-prefixed session keys (for example, `agent:main`) in `agent` and `agent.identity.get` instead of silently resolving them to the default agent, preventing accidental cross-session routing. (#15707) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Chat: harden `chat.send` inbound message handling by rejecting null bytes, stripping unsafe control characters, and normalizing Unicode to NFC before dispatch. (#8593) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Gateway/Send: return an actionable error when `send` targets internal-only `webchat`, guiding callers to use `chat.send` or a deliverable channel. (#15703) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- Gateway/Commands: keep webchat command authorization on the internal `webchat` context instead of inferring another provider from channel allowlists, fixing dropped `/new`/`/status` commands in Control UI when channel allowlists are configured. (#7189) Thanks @karlisbergmanis-lv.
- Control UI: prevent stored XSS via assistant name/avatar by removing inline script injection, serving bootstrap config as JSON, and enforcing `script-src 'self'`. Thanks @Adam55A-code.
- Agents/Security: sanitize workspace paths before embedding into LLM prompts (strip Unicode control/format chars) to prevent instruction injection via malicious directory names. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Agents/Sandbox: clarify system prompt path guidance so sandbox `bash/exec` uses container paths (for example `/workspace`) while file tools keep host-bridge mapping, avoiding first-attempt path misses from host-only absolute paths in sandbox command execution. (#17693) Thanks @app/juniordevbot.
- Agents/Context: apply configured model `contextWindow` overrides after provider discovery so `lookupContextTokens()` honors operator config values (including discovery-failure paths). (#17404) Thanks @michaelbship and @vignesh07.
- Agents/Context: derive `lookupContextTokens()` from auth-available model metadata and keep the smallest discovered context window for duplicate model ids, preventing cross-provider cache collisions from overestimating session context limits. (#17586) Thanks @githabideri and @vignesh07.
- Agents/OpenAI: force `store=true` for direct OpenAI Responses/Codex runs to preserve multi-turn server-side conversation state, while leaving proxy/non-OpenAI endpoints unchanged. (#16803) Thanks @mark9232 and @vignesh07.
- Memory/FTS: make `buildFtsQuery` Unicode-aware so non-ASCII queries (including CJK) produce keyword tokens instead of falling back to vector-only search. (#17672) Thanks @KinGP5471.
- Auto-reply/Compaction: resolve `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` placeholders with timezone-aware runtime dates and append a `Current time:` line to memory-flush turns, preventing wrong-year memory filenames without making the system prompt time-variant. (#17603, #17633) Thanks @nicholaspapadam-wq and @vignesh07.
- Auth/Cooldowns: auto-expire stale auth profile cooldowns when `cooldownUntil` or `disabledUntil` timestamps have passed, and reset `errorCount` so the next transient failure does not immediately escalate to a disproportionately long cooldown. Handles `cooldownUntil` and `disabledUntil` independently. (#3604) Thanks @nabbilkhan.
- Agents: return an explicit timeout error reply when an embedded run times out before producing any payloads, preventing silent dropped turns during slow cache-refresh transitions. (#16659) Thanks @liaosvcaf and @vignesh07.
- Group chats: always inject group chat context (name, participants, reply guidance) into the system prompt on every turn, not just the first. Prevents the model from losing awareness of which group it's in and incorrectly using the message tool to send to the same group. (#14447) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Browser/Agents: when browser control service is unavailable, return explicit non-retry guidance (instead of "try again") so models do not loop on repeated browser tool calls until timeout. (#17673) Thanks @austenstone.
- Subagents: use child-run-based deterministic announce idempotency keys across direct and queued delivery paths (with legacy queued-item fallback) to prevent duplicate announce retries without collapsing distinct same-millisecond announces. (#17150) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- Subagents/Models: preserve `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` when subagent sessions carry a model override, so subagent runs fail over to configured fallback models instead of retrying only the overridden primary model.
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: omit `message_thread_id` for DM sends/draft previews and keep forum-topic handling (`id=1` general omitted, non-general kept), preventing DM failures with `400 Bad Request: message thread not found`. (#10942) Thanks @garnetlyx.
- Telegram: replace inbound `<media:audio>` placeholder with successful preflight voice transcript in message body context, preventing placeholder-only prompt bodies for mention-gated voice messages. (#16789) Thanks @Limitless2023.
- Telegram: retry inbound media `getFile` calls (3 attempts with backoff) and gracefully fall back to placeholder-only processing when retries fail, preventing dropped voice/media messages on transient Telegram network errors. (#16154) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: finalize streaming preview replies in place instead of sending a second final message, preventing duplicate Telegram assistant outputs at stream completion. (#17218) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: preserve channel session continuity when runtime payloads omit `message.channelId` by falling back to event/raw `channel_id` values for routing/session keys, so same-channel messages keep history across turns/restarts. Also align diagnostics so active Discord runs no longer appear as `sessionKey=unknown`. (#17622) Thanks @shakkernerd.
- Discord: dedupe native skill commands by skill name in multi-agent setups to prevent duplicated slash commands with `_2` suffixes. (#17365) Thanks @seewhyme.
- Discord: ensure role allowlist matching uses raw role IDs for message routing authorization. Thanks @xinhuagu.
- Discord: skip text-based exec approval forwarding in favor of Discord's component-based approval UI. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI/Agents: hide `BOOTSTRAP.md` in the Agents Files list after onboarding is completed, avoiding confusing missing-file warnings for completed workspaces. (#17491) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Gateway/Memory: initialize QMD startup sync for every configured agent (not just the default agent), so `memory.qmd.update.onBoot` is effective across multi-agent setups. (#17663) Thanks @HenryLoenwind.
- Auto-reply/WhatsApp/TUI/Web: when a final assistant message is `NO_REPLY` and a messaging tool send succeeded, mirror the delivered messaging-tool text into session-visible assistant output so TUI/Web no longer show `NO_REPLY` placeholders. (#7010) Thanks @Morrowind-Xie.
- Cron: infer `payload.kind="agentTurn"` for model-only `cron.update` payload patches, so partial agent-turn updates do not fail validation when `kind` is omitted. (#15664) Thanks @rodrigouroz.
- TUI: make searchable-select filtering and highlight rendering ANSI-aware so queries ignore hidden escape codes and no longer corrupt ANSI styling sequences during match highlighting. (#4519) Thanks @bee4come.
- TUI/Windows: coalesce rapid single-line submit bursts in Git Bash into one multiline message as a fallback when bracketed paste is unavailable, preventing pasted multiline text from being split into multiple sends. (#4986) Thanks @adamkane.
- TUI: suppress false `(no output)` placeholders for non-local empty final events during concurrent runs, preventing external-channel replies from showing empty assistant bubbles while a local run is still streaming. (#5782) Thanks @LagWizard and @vignesh07.
- TUI: preserve copy-sensitive long tokens (URLs/paths/file-like identifiers) during wrapping and overflow sanitization so wrapped output no longer inserts spaces that corrupt copy/paste values. (#17515, #17466, #17505) Thanks @abe238, @trevorpan, and @JasonCry.
- CLI/Build: make legacy daemon CLI compatibility shim generation tolerant of minimal tsdown daemon export sets, while preserving restart/register compatibility aliases and surfacing explicit errors for unavailable legacy daemon commands. Thanks @vignesh07.

## 2026.2.14

### Changes

- Telegram: add poll sending via `openclaw message poll` (duration seconds, silent delivery, anonymity controls). (#16209) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Slack/Discord: add `dmPolicy` + `allowFrom` config aliases for DM access control; legacy `dm.policy` + `dm.allowFrom` keys remain supported and `openclaw doctor --fix` can migrate them.
- Discord: allow exec approval prompts to target channels or both DM+channel via `channels.discord.execApprovals.target`. (#16051) Thanks @leonnardo.
- Sandbox: add `sandbox.browser.binds` to configure browser-container bind mounts separately from exec containers. (#16230) Thanks @seheepeak.
- Discord: add debug logging for message routing decisions to improve `--debug` tracing. (#16202) Thanks @jayleekr.
- Agents: add optional `messages.suppressToolErrors` config to hide non-mutating tool-failure warnings from user-facing chat while still surfacing mutating failures. (#16620) Thanks @vai-oro.

### Fixes

- CLI/Installation: fix Docker installation hangs on macOS. (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Models: fix antigravity opus 4.6 availability follow-up. (#12845) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Sessions/Telegram: restrict session tool targeting by default to the current session tree (`tools.sessions.visibility`, default `tree`) with sandbox clamping, and pass configured per-account Telegram webhook secrets in webhook mode when no explicit override is provided. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- CLI/Plugins: ensure `openclaw message send` exits after successful delivery across plugin-backed channels so one-shot sends do not hang. (#16491) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Plugins: run registered plugin `gateway_stop` hooks before `openclaw message` exits (success and failure paths), so plugin-backed channels can clean up one-shot CLI resources. (#16580) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- WhatsApp: honor per-account `dmPolicy` overrides (account-level settings now take precedence over channel defaults for inbound DMs). (#10082) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Telegram: when `channels.telegram.commands.native` is `false`, exclude plugin commands from `setMyCommands` menu registration while keeping plugin slash handlers callable. (#15132) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- LINE: return 200 OK for Developers Console "Verify" requests (`{"events":[]}`) without `X-Line-Signature`, while still requiring signatures for real deliveries. (#16582) Thanks @arosstale.
- Cron: deliver text-only output directly when `delivery.to` is set so cron recipients get full output instead of summaries. (#16360) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Slack: preserve agent identity (name and icon) when cron jobs deliver outbound messages. (#16242) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Media: accept `MEDIA:`-prefixed paths (lenient whitespace) when loading outbound media to prevent `ENOENT` for tool-returned local media paths. (#13107) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Media understanding: treat binary `application/vnd.*`/zip/octet-stream attachments as non-text (while keeping vendor `+json`/`+xml` text-eligible) so Office/ZIP files are not inlined into prompt body text. (#16513) Thanks @rmramsey32.
- Agents: deliver tool result media (screenshots, images, audio) to channels regardless of verbose level. (#11735) Thanks @strelov1.
- Auto-reply/Block streaming: strip leading whitespace from streamed block replies so messages starting with blank lines no longer deliver visible leading empty lines. (#16422) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- Auto-reply/Queue: keep queued followups and overflow summaries when drain attempts fail, then retry delivery instead of dropping messages on transient errors. (#16771) Thanks @mmhzlrj.
- Agents/Image tool: allow workspace-local image paths by including the active workspace directory in local media allowlists, and trust sandbox-validated paths in image loaders to prevent false "not under an allowed directory" rejections. (#15541)
- Agents/Image tool: propagate the effective workspace root into tool wiring so workspace-local image paths are accepted by default when running without an explicit `workspaceDir`. (#16722)
- BlueBubbles: include sender identity in group chat envelopes and pass clean message text to the agent prompt, aligning with iMessage/Signal formatting. (#16210) Thanks @zerone0x.
- CLI: fix lazy core command registration so top-level maintenance commands (`doctor`, `dashboard`, `reset`, `uninstall`) resolve correctly instead of exposing a non-functional `maintenance` placeholder command.
- CLI/Dashboard: when `gateway.bind=lan`, generate localhost dashboard URLs to satisfy browser secure-context requirements while preserving non-LAN bind behavior. (#16434) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- TUI/Gateway: resolve local gateway target URL from `gateway.bind` mode (tailnet/lan) instead of hardcoded localhost so `openclaw tui` connects when gateway is non-loopback. (#16299) Thanks @cortexuvula.
- TUI: honor explicit `--session <key>` in `openclaw tui` even when `session.scope` is `global`, so named sessions no longer collapse into shared global history. (#16575) Thanks @cinqu.
- TUI: use available terminal width for session name display in searchable select lists. (#16238) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- TUI: preserve in-flight streaming replies when a different run finalizes concurrently (avoid clearing active run or reloading history mid-stream). (#10704) Thanks @axschr73.
- TUI: keep pre-tool streamed text visible when later tool-boundary deltas temporarily omit earlier text blocks. (#6958) Thanks @KrisKind75.
- TUI: sanitize ANSI/control-heavy history text, redact binary-like lines, and split pathological long unbroken tokens before rendering to prevent startup crashes on binary attachment history. (#13007) Thanks @wilkinspoe.
- TUI: harden render-time sanitizer for narrow terminals by chunking moderately long unbroken tokens and adding fast-path sanitization guards to reduce overhead on normal text. (#5355) Thanks @tingxueren.
- TUI: render assistant body text in terminal default foreground (instead of fixed light ANSI color) so contrast remains readable on light themes such as Solarized Light. (#16750) Thanks @paymog.
- TUI/Hooks: pass explicit reset reason (`new` vs `reset`) through `sessions.reset` and emit internal command hooks for gateway-triggered resets so `/new` hook workflows fire in TUI/webchat.
- Gateway/Agent: route bare `/new` and `/reset` through `sessions.reset` before running the fresh-session greeting prompt, so reset commands clear the current session in-place instead of falling through to normal agent runs. (#16732) Thanks @kdotndot and @vignesh07.
- Cron: prevent `cron list`/`cron status` from silently skipping past-due recurring jobs by using maintenance recompute semantics. (#16156) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Cron: repair missing/corrupt `nextRunAtMs` for the updated job without globally recomputing unrelated due jobs during `cron update`. (#15750)
- Cron: treat persisted jobs with missing `enabled` as enabled by default across update/list/timer due-path checks, and add regression coverage for missing-`enabled` store records. (#15433) Thanks @eternauta1337.
- Cron: skip missed-job replay on startup for jobs interrupted mid-run (stale `runningAtMs` markers), preventing restart loops for self-restarting jobs such as update tasks. (#16694) Thanks @sbmilburn.
- Heartbeat/Cron: treat cron-tagged queued system events as cron reminders even on interval wakes, so isolated cron announce summaries no longer run under the default heartbeat prompt. (#14947) Thanks @archedark-ada and @vignesh07.
- Discord: prefer gateway guild id when logging inbound messages so cached-miss guilds do not appear as `guild=dm`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: treat empty per-guild `channels: {}` config maps as no channel allowlist (not deny-all), so `groupPolicy: "open"` guilds without explicit channel entries continue to receive messages. (#16714) Thanks @xqliu.
- Models/CLI: guard `models status` string trimming paths to prevent crashes from malformed non-string config values. (#16395) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Gateway/Subagents: preserve queued announce items and summary state on delivery errors, retry failed announce drains, and avoid dropping unsent announcements on timeout/failure. (#16729) Thanks @Clawdette-Workspace.
- Gateway/Config: make `config.patch` merge object arrays by `id` (for example `agents.list`) instead of replacing the whole array, so partial agent updates do not silently delete unrelated agents. (#6766) Thanks @lightclient.
- Webchat/Prompts: stop injecting direct-chat `conversation_label` into inbound untrusted metadata context blocks, preventing internal label noise from leaking into visible chat replies. (#16556) Thanks @nberardi.
- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id`, `chat_id`, `reply_to_id`, and optional `message_id_full` metadata fields so action tools (for example reactions) can target the triggering message without relying on user text. (#17662) Thanks @MaikiMolto.
- Gateway/Sessions: abort active embedded runs and clear queued session work before `sessions.reset`, returning unavailable if the run does not stop in time. (#16576) Thanks @Grynn.
- Sessions/Agents: harden transcript path resolution for mismatched agent context by preserving explicit store roots and adding safe absolute-path fallback to the correct agent sessions directory. (#16288) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: add a safety timeout around embedded `session.compact()` to ensure stalled compaction runs settle and release blocked session lanes. (#16331) Thanks @BinHPdev.
- Agents/Tools: make required-parameter validation errors list missing fields and instruct: "Supply correct parameters before retrying," reducing repeated invalid tool-call loops (for example `read({})`). (#14729)
- Agents: keep unresolved mutating tool failures visible until the same action retry succeeds, scope mutation-error surfacing to mutating calls (including `session_status` model changes), and dedupe duplicate failure warnings in outbound replies. (#16131) Thanks @Swader.
- Agents/Process/Bootstrap: preserve unbounded `process log` offset-only pagination (default tail applies only when both `offset` and `limit` are omitted) and enforce strict `bootstrapTotalMaxChars` budgeting across injected bootstrap content (including markers), skipping additional injection when remaining budget is too small. (#16539) Thanks @CharlieGreenman.
- Agents/Workspace: persist bootstrap onboarding state so partially initialized workspaces recover missing `BOOTSTRAP.md` once, while completed onboarding keeps BOOTSTRAP deleted even if runtime files are later recreated. Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Agents/Workspace: create `BOOTSTRAP.md` when core workspace files are seeded in partially initialized workspaces, while keeping BOOTSTRAP one-shot after onboarding deletion. (#16457) Thanks @robbyczgw-cla.
- Agents: classify external timeout aborts during compaction the same as internal timeouts, preventing unnecessary auth-profile rotation and preserving compaction-timeout snapshot fallback behavior. (#9855) Thanks @mverrilli.
- Agents: treat empty-stream provider failures (`request ended without sending any chunks`) as timeout-class failover signals, enabling auth-profile rotation/fallback and showing a friendly timeout message instead of raw provider errors. (#10210) Thanks @zenchantlive.
- Agents: treat `read` tool `file_path` arguments as valid in tool-start diagnostics to avoid false “read tool called without path” warnings when alias parameters are used. (#16717) Thanks @Stache73.
- Agents/Transcript: drop malformed tool-call blocks with blank required fields (`id`/`name` or missing `input`/`arguments`) during session transcript repair to prevent persistent tool-call corruption on future turns. (#15485) Thanks @mike-zachariades.
- Tools/Write/Edit: normalize structured text-block arguments for `content`/`oldText`/`newText` before filesystem edits, preventing JSON-like file corruption and false “exact text not found” misses from block-form params. (#16778) Thanks @danielpipernz.
- Ollama/Agents: avoid forcing `<final>` tag enforcement for Ollama models, which could suppress all output as `(no output)`. (#16191) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Plugins: suppress false duplicate plugin id warnings when the same extension is discovered via multiple paths (config/workspace/global vs bundled), while still warning on genuine duplicates. (#16222) Thanks @shadril238.
- Agents/Process: supervise PTY/child process lifecycles with explicit ownership, cancellation, timeouts, and deterministic cleanup, preventing Codex/Pi PTY sessions from dying or stalling on resume. (#14257) Thanks @onutc.
- Skills: watch `SKILL.md` only when refreshing skills snapshot to avoid file-descriptor exhaustion in large data trees. (#11325) Thanks @household-bard.
- Memory/QMD: make `memory status` read-only by skipping QMD boot update/embed side effects for status-only manager checks.
- Memory/QMD: keep original QMD failures when builtin fallback initialization fails (for example missing embedding API keys), instead of replacing them with fallback init errors.
- Memory/Builtin: keep `memory status` dirty reporting stable across invocations by deriving status-only manager dirty state from persisted index metadata instead of process-start defaults. (#10863) Thanks @BarryYangi.
- Memory/QMD: cap QMD command output buffering to prevent memory exhaustion from pathological `qmd` command output.
- Memory/QMD: parse qmd scope keys once per request to avoid repeated parsing in scope checks.
- Memory/QMD: query QMD index using exact docid matches before falling back to prefix lookup for better recall correctness and index efficiency.
- Memory/QMD: pass result limits to `search`/`vsearch` commands so QMD can cap results earlier.
- Memory/QMD: avoid reading full markdown files when a `from/lines` window is requested in QMD reads.
- Memory/QMD: skip rewriting unchanged session export markdown files during sync to reduce disk churn.
- Memory/QMD: make QMD result JSON parsing resilient to noisy command output by extracting the first JSON array from noisy `stdout`.
- Memory/QMD: treat prefixed `no results found` marker output as an empty result set in qmd JSON parsing. (#11302) Thanks @blazerui.
- Memory/QMD: avoid multi-collection `query` ranking corruption by running one `qmd query -c <collection>` per managed collection and merging by best score (also used for `search`/`vsearch` fallback-to-query). (#16740) Thanks @volarian-vai.
- Memory/QMD: rebind managed collections when existing collection metadata drifts (including sessions name-only listings), preventing non-default agents from reusing another agent's `sessions` collection path. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Memory/QMD: make `openclaw memory index` verify and print the active QMD index file path/size, and fail when QMD leaves a missing or zero-byte index artifact after an update. (#16775) Thanks @Shunamxiao.
- Memory/QMD: detect null-byte `ENOTDIR` update failures, rebuild managed collections once, and retry update to self-heal corrupted collection metadata. (#12919) Thanks @jorgejhms.
- Memory/QMD/Security: add `rawKeyPrefix` support for QMD scope rules and preserve legacy `keyPrefix: "agent:..."` matching, preventing scoped deny bypass when operators match agent-prefixed session keys.
- Memory/Builtin: narrow memory watcher targets to markdown globs and ignore dependency/venv directories to reduce file-descriptor pressure during memory sync startup. (#11721) Thanks @rex05ai.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: treat recalled memories as untrusted context (escape injected memory text + explicit non-instruction framing), skip likely prompt-injection payloads during auto-capture, and restrict auto-capture to user messages to reduce memory-poisoning risk. (#12524) Thanks @davidschmid24.
- Security/Memory-LanceDB: require explicit `autoCapture: true` opt-in (default is now disabled) to prevent automatic PII capture unless operators intentionally enable it. (#12552) Thanks @fr33d3m0n.
- Diagnostics/Memory: prune stale diagnostic session state entries and cap tracked session states to prevent unbounded in-memory growth on long-running gateways. (#5136) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.
- Gateway/Memory: clean up `agentRunSeq` tracking on run completion/abort and enforce maintenance-time cap pruning to prevent unbounded sequence-map growth over long uptimes. (#6036) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.
- Auto-reply/Memory: bound `ABORT_MEMORY` growth by evicting oldest entries and deleting reset (`false`) flags so abort state tracking cannot grow unbounded over long uptimes. (#6629) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.
- Slack/Memory: bound thread-starter cache growth with TTL + max-size pruning to prevent long-running Slack gateways from accumulating unbounded thread cache state. (#5258) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.
- Outbound/Memory: bound directory cache growth with max-size eviction and proactive TTL pruning to prevent long-running gateways from accumulating unbounded directory entries. (#5140) Thanks @coygeek and @vignesh07.
- Skills/Memory: remove disconnected nodes from remote-skills cache to prevent stale node metadata from accumulating over long uptimes. (#6760) Thanks @coygeek.
- Sandbox/Tools: make sandbox file tools bind-mount aware (including absolute container paths) and enforce read-only bind semantics for writes. (#16379) Thanks @tasaankaeris.
- Sandbox/Prompts: show the sandbox container workdir as the prompt working directory and clarify host-path usage for file tools, preventing host-path `exec` failures in sandbox sessions. (#16790) Thanks @carrotRakko.
- Media/Security: allow local media reads from OpenClaw state `workspace/` and `sandboxes/` roots by default so generated workspace media can be delivered without unsafe global path bypasses. (#15541) Thanks @lanceji.
- Media/Security: harden local media allowlist bypasses by requiring an explicit `readFile` override when callers mark paths as validated, and reject filesystem-root `localRoots` entries. (#16739)
- Media/Security: allow outbound local media reads from the active agent workspace (including `workspace-<agentId>`) via agent-scoped local roots, avoiding broad global allowlisting of all per-agent workspaces. (#17136) Thanks @MisterGuy420.
- Outbound/Media: thread explicit `agentId` through core `sendMessage` direct-delivery path so agent-scoped local media roots apply even when mirror metadata is absent. (#17268) Thanks @gumadeiras.
- Discord/Security: harden voice message media loading (SSRF + allowed-local-root checks) so tool-supplied paths/URLs cannot be used to probe internal URLs or read arbitrary local files.
- Security/BlueBubbles: require explicit `mediaLocalRoots` allowlists for local outbound media path reads to prevent local file disclosure. (#16322) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/BlueBubbles: reject ambiguous shared-path webhook routing when multiple webhook targets match the same guid/password.
- Security/BlueBubbles: harden BlueBubbles webhook auth behind reverse proxies by only accepting passwordless webhooks for direct localhost loopback requests (forwarded/proxied requests now require a password). Thanks @simecek.
- Feishu/Security: harden media URL fetching against SSRF and local file disclosure. (#16285) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Security/Zalo: reject ambiguous shared-path webhook routing when multiple webhook targets match the same secret.

- Security/Signal: harden signal-cli archive extraction during install to prevent path traversal outside the install root.
- Security/Hooks: restrict hook transform modules to `~/.openclaw/hooks/transforms` (prevents path traversal/escape module loads via config). Config note: `hooks.transformsDir` must now be within that directory. Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Hooks: ignore hook package manifest entries that point outside the package directory (prevents out-of-tree handler loads during hook discovery).
- Security/Archive: enforce archive extraction entry/size limits to prevent resource exhaustion from high-expansion ZIP/TAR archives. Thanks @vincentkoc.

- Security/Skills: harden archive extraction for download-installed skills to prevent path traversal outside the target directory. Thanks @markmusson.
- Security/Slack: compute command authorization for DM slash commands even when `dmPolicy=open`, preventing unauthorized users from running privileged commands via DM. Thanks @christos-eth.
- Security/Pairing: scope pairing allowlist writes/reads to channel accounts (for example `telegram:yy`), and propagate account-aware pairing approvals so multi-account channels do not share a single per-channel pairing allowFrom store. (#17631) Thanks @crazytan.
- Security/iMessage: keep DM pairing-store identities out of group allowlist authorization (prevents cross-context command authorization). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Google Chat: deprecate `users/<email>` allowlists (treat `users/...` as immutable user id only); keep raw email allowlists for usability. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Google Chat: reject ambiguous shared-path webhook routing when multiple webhook targets verify successfully (prevents cross-account policy-context misrouting). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Security: require numeric Telegram sender IDs for allowlist authorization (reject `@username` principals), auto-resolve `@username` to IDs in `openclaw doctor --fix` (when possible), and warn in `openclaw security audit` when legacy configs contain usernames. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Telegram/Security: reject Telegram webhook startup when `webhookSecret` is missing or empty (prevents unauthenticated webhook request forgery). Thanks @yueyueL.
- Security/Windows: avoid shell invocation when spawning child processes to prevent cmd.exe metacharacter injection via untrusted CLI arguments (e.g. agent prompt text).
- Telegram: set webhook callback timeout handling to `onTimeout: "return"` (10s) so long-running update processing no longer emits webhook 500s and retry storms. (#16763) Thanks @chansearrington.
- Signal: preserve case-sensitive `group:` target IDs during normalization so mixed-case group IDs no longer fail with `Group not found`. (#16748) Thanks @repfigit.
- Security/Agents: scope CLI process cleanup to owned child PIDs to avoid killing unrelated processes on shared hosts. Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Agents: enforce workspace-root path bounds for `apply_patch` in non-sandbox mode to block traversal and symlink escape writes. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Agents: enforce symlink-escape checks for `apply_patch` delete hunks under `workspaceOnly`, while still allowing deleting the symlink itself. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Agents (macOS): prevent shell injection when writing Claude CLI keychain credentials. (#15924) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- macOS: hard-limit unkeyed `openclaw://agent` deep links and ignore `deliver` / `to` / `channel` unless a valid unattended key is provided. Thanks @Cillian-Collins.
- Scripts/Security: validate GitHub logins and avoid shell invocation in `scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` to prevent command injection via malicious commit records. Thanks @scanleale.
- Security: fix Chutes manual OAuth login state validation by requiring the full redirect URL (reject code-only pastes) (thanks @aether-ai-agent).
- Security/Gateway: harden tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides by restricting them to loopback or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Gateway: block `system.execApprovals.*` via `node.invoke` (use `exec.approvals.node.*` instead). Thanks @christos-eth.
- Security/Gateway: reject oversized base64 chat attachments before decoding to avoid large allocations. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Gateway: stop returning raw resolved config values in `skills.status` requirement checks (prevents operator.read clients from reading secrets). Thanks @simecek.
- Security/Net: fix SSRF guard bypass via full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals (blocks loopback/private/metadata access). Thanks @yueyueL.
- Security/Browser: harden browser control file upload + download helpers to prevent path traversal / local file disclosure. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: block cross-origin mutating requests to loopback browser control routes (CSRF hardening). Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Security/Node Host: enforce `system.run` rawCommand/argv consistency to prevent allowlist/approval bypass. Thanks @christos-eth.
- Security/Exec approvals: prevent safeBins allowlist bypass via shell expansion (host exec allowlist mode only; not enabled by default). Thanks @christos-eth.
- Security/Exec: harden PATH handling by disabling project-local `node_modules/.bin` bootstrapping by default, disallowing node-host `PATH` overrides, and spawning ACP servers via the current executable by default. Thanks @akhmittra.
- Security/Tlon: harden Urbit URL fetching against SSRF by blocking private/internal hosts by default (opt-in: `channels.tlon.allowPrivateNetwork`). Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call (Telnyx): require webhook signature verification when receiving inbound events; configs without `telnyx.publicKey` are now rejected unless `skipSignatureVerification` is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Voice Call: require valid Twilio webhook signatures even when ngrok free tier loopback compatibility mode is enabled. Thanks @p80n-sec.
- Security/Discovery: stop treating Bonjour TXT records as authoritative routing (prefer resolved service endpoints) and prevent discovery from overriding stored TLS pins; autoconnect now requires a previously trusted gateway. Thanks @simecek.

## 2026.2.13

### Changes

- Install: add optional Podman-based setup: `setup-podman.sh` for one-time host setup (openclaw user, image, launch script, systemd quadlet), `run-openclaw-podman.sh launch` / `launch setup`; systemd Quadlet unit for openclaw user service; docs for rootless container, openclaw user (subuid/subgid), and quadlet (troubleshooting). (#16273) Thanks @DarwinsBuddy.
- Discord: send voice messages with waveform previews from local audio files (including silent delivery). (#7253) Thanks @nyanjou.
- Discord: add configurable presence status/activity/type/url (custom status defaults to activity text). (#10855) Thanks @h0tp-ftw.
- Slack/Plugins: add thread-ownership outbound gating via `message_sending` hooks, including @-mention bypass tracking and Slack outbound hook wiring for cancel/modify behavior. (#15775) Thanks @DarlingtonDeveloper.
- Agents: add synthetic catalog support for `hf:zai-org/GLM-5`. (#15867) Thanks @battman21.
- Skills: remove duplicate `local-places` Google Places skill/proxy and keep `goplaces` as the single supported Google Places path.
- Agents: add pre-prompt context diagnostics (`messages`, `systemPromptChars`, `promptChars`, provider/model, session file) before embedded runner prompt calls to improve overflow debugging. (#8930) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- Onboarding/Providers: add first-class Hugging Face Inference provider support (provider wiring, onboarding auth choice/API key flow, and default-model selection), and preserve Hugging Face auth intent in auth-choice remapping (`tokenProvider=huggingface` with `authChoice=apiKey`) while skipping env-override prompts when an explicit token is provided. (#13472) Thanks @Josephrp.
- Onboarding/Providers: add `minimax-api-key-cn` auth choice for the MiniMax China API endpoint. (#15191) Thanks @liuy.

### Breaking

- Config/State: removed legacy `.moltbot` auto-detection/migration and `moltbot.json` config candidates. If you still have state/config under `~/.moltbot`, move it to `~/.openclaw` (recommended) or set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` explicitly.

### Fixes

- Gateway/Auth: add trusted-proxy mode hardening follow-ups by keeping `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_*` env compatibility, auto-normalizing invalid setup combinations in interactive `gateway configure` (trusted-proxy forces `bind=lan` and disables Tailscale serve/funnel), and suppressing shared-secret/rate-limit audit findings that do not apply to trusted-proxy deployments. (#15940) Thanks @nickytonline.
- Docs/Hooks: update hooks documentation URLs to the new `/automation/hooks` location. (#16165) Thanks @nicholascyh.
- Security/Audit: warn when `gateway.tools.allow` re-enables default-denied tools over HTTP `POST /tools/invoke`, since this can increase RCE blast radius if the gateway is reachable.
- Security/Plugins/Hooks: harden npm-based installs by restricting specs to registry packages only, passing `--ignore-scripts` to `npm pack`, and cleaning up temp install directories.
- Security/Sessions: preserve inter-session input provenance for routed prompts so delegated/internal sessions are not treated as direct external user instructions. Thanks @anbecker.
- Feishu: stop persistent Typing reaction on NO_REPLY/suppressed runs by wiring reply-dispatcher cleanup to remove typing indicators. (#15464) Thanks @arosstale.
- Agents: strip leading empty lines from `sanitizeUserFacingText` output and normalize whitespace-only outputs to empty text. (#16158) Thanks @mcinteerj.
- BlueBubbles: gracefully degrade when Private API is disabled by filtering private-only actions, skipping private-only reactions/reply effects, and avoiding private reply markers so non-private flows remain usable. (#16002) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Outbound: add a write-ahead delivery queue with crash-recovery retries to prevent lost outbound messages after gateway restarts. (#15636) Thanks @nabbilkhan, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Auto-reply/Threading: auto-inject implicit reply threading so `replyToMode` works without requiring model-emitted `[[reply_to_current]]`, while preserving `replyToMode: "off"` behavior for implicit Slack replies and keeping block-streaming chunk coalescing stable under `replyToMode: "first"`. (#14976) Thanks @Diaspar4u.
- Auto-reply/Threading: honor explicit `[[reply_to_*]]` tags even when `replyToMode` is `off`. (#16174) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Plugins/Threading: rename `allowTagsWhenOff` to `allowExplicitReplyTagsWhenOff` and keep the old key as a deprecated alias for compatibility. (#16189)
- Outbound/Threading: pass `replyTo` and `threadId` from `message send` tool actions through the core outbound send path to channel adapters, preserving thread/reply routing. (#14948) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Auto-reply/Media: allow image-only inbound messages (no caption) to reach the agent instead of short-circuiting as empty text, and preserve thread context in queued/followup prompt bodies for media-only runs. (#11916) Thanks @arosstale.
- Discord: route autoThread replies to existing threads instead of the root channel. (#8302) Thanks @gavinbmoore, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Web UI: add `img` to DOMPurify allowed tags and `src`/`alt` to allowed attributes so markdown images render in webchat instead of being stripped. (#15437) Thanks @lailoo.
- Telegram/Matrix: treat MP3 and M4A (including `audio/mp4`) as voice-compatible for `asVoice` routing, and keep WAV/AAC falling back to regular audio sends. (#15438) Thanks @azade-c.
- WhatsApp: preserve outbound document filenames for web-session document sends instead of always sending `"file"`. (#15594) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Telegram: cap bot menu registration to Telegram's 100-command limit with an overflow warning while keeping typed hidden commands available. (#15844) Thanks @battman21.
- Telegram: scope skill commands to the resolved agent for default accounts so `setMyCommands` no longer triggers `BOT_COMMANDS_TOO_MUCH` when multiple agents are configured. (#15599)
- Discord: avoid misrouting numeric guild allowlist entries to `/channels/<guildId>` by prefixing guild-only inputs with `guild:` during resolution. (#12326) Thanks @headswim.
- Memory/QMD: default `memory.qmd.searchMode` to `search` for faster CPU-only recall and always scope `search`/`vsearch` requests to managed collections (auto-falling back to `query` when required). (#16047) Thanks @togotago.
- Memory/LanceDB: add configurable `captureMaxChars` for auto-capture while keeping the legacy 500-char default. (#16641) Thanks @ciberponk.
- MS Teams: preserve parsed mention entities/text when appending OneDrive fallback file links, and accept broader real-world Teams mention ID formats (`29:...`, `8:orgid:...`) while still rejecting placeholder patterns. (#15436) Thanks @hyojin.
- Media: classify `text/*` MIME types as documents in media-kind routing so text attachments are no longer treated as unknown. (#12237) Thanks @arosstale.
- Inbound/Web UI: preserve literal `\n` sequences when normalizing inbound text so Windows paths like `C:\\Work\\nxxx\\README.md` are not corrupted. (#11547) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- TUI/Streaming: preserve richer streamed assistant text when final payload drops pre-tool-call text blocks, while keeping non-empty final payload authoritative for plain-text updates. (#15452) Thanks @TsekaLuk.
- Providers/MiniMax: switch implicit MiniMax API-key provider from `openai-completions` to `anthropic-messages` with the correct Anthropic-compatible base URL, fixing `invalid role: developer (2013)` errors on MiniMax M2.5. (#15275) Thanks @lailoo.
- Ollama/Agents: use resolved model/provider base URLs for native `/api/chat` streaming (including aliased providers), normalize `/v1` endpoints, and forward abort + `maxTokens` stream options for reliable cancellation and token caps. (#11853) Thanks @BrokenFinger98.
- OpenAI Codex/Spark: implement end-to-end `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` support across fallback/thinking/model resolution and `models list` forward-compat visibility. (#14990, #15174) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y, @loiie45e.
- Agents/Codex: allow `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` in forward-compat fallback, live model filtering, and thinking presets, and fix model-picker recognition for spark. (#14990) Thanks @L-U-C-K-Y.
- Models/Codex: resolve configured `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` through forward-compat fallback during `models list`, so it is not incorrectly tagged as missing when runtime resolution succeeds. (#15174) Thanks @loiie45e.
- OpenAI Codex/Auth: bridge OpenClaw OAuth profiles into `pi` `auth.json` so model discovery and models-list registry resolution can use Codex OAuth credentials. (#15184) Thanks @loiie45e.
- Auth/OpenAI Codex: share OAuth login handling across onboarding and `models auth login --provider openai-codex`, keep onboarding alive when OAuth fails, and surface a direct OAuth help note instead of terminating the wizard. (#15406, follow-up to #14552) Thanks @zhiluo20.
- Onboarding/Providers: add vLLM as an onboarding provider with model discovery, auth profile wiring, and non-interactive auth-choice validation. (#12577) Thanks @gejifeng.
- Onboarding/CLI: restore terminal state without resuming paused `stdin`, so onboarding exits cleanly (including Docker TTY installs that would otherwise hang). (#12972) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Signal/Install: auto-install `signal-cli` via Homebrew on non-x64 Linux architectures, avoiding x86_64 native binary `Exec format error` failures on arm64/arm hosts. (#15443) Thanks @jogvan-k.
- macOS Voice Wake: fix a crash in trigger trimming for CJK/Unicode transcripts by matching and slicing on original-string ranges instead of transformed-string indices. (#11052) Thanks @Flash-LHR.
- Mattermost (plugin): retry websocket monitor connections with exponential backoff and abort-aware teardown so transient connect failures no longer permanently stop monitoring. (#14962) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Discord/Agents: apply channel/group `historyLimit` during embedded-runner history compaction to prevent long-running channel sessions from bypassing truncation and overflowing context windows. (#11224) Thanks @shadril238.
- Outbound targets: fail closed for WhatsApp/Twitch/Google Chat fallback paths so invalid or missing targets are dropped instead of rerouted, and align resolver hints with strict target requirements. (#13578) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Gateway/Restart: clear stale command-queue and heartbeat wake runtime state after SIGUSR1 in-process restarts to prevent zombie gateway behavior where queued work stops draining. (#15195) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: prevent scheduler silent-death races during runner reloads, preserve retry cooldown backoff under wake bursts, and prioritize user/action wake causes over interval/retry reasons when coalescing. (#15108) Thanks @joeykrug.
- Heartbeat: allow explicit wake (`wake`) and hook wake (`hook:*`) reasons to run even when `HEARTBEAT.md` is effectively empty so queued system events are processed. (#14527) Thanks @arosstale.
- Auto-reply/Heartbeat: strip sentence-ending `HEARTBEAT_OK` tokens even when followed by up to 4 punctuation characters, while preserving surrounding sentence punctuation. (#15847) Thanks @Spacefish.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` when resolving existing transcript paths in reply runs so non-default agents and heartbeat/chat handlers no longer fail with `Session file path must be within sessions directory`. (#15141) Thanks @Goldenmonstew.
- Sessions/Agents: pass `agentId` through status and usage transcript-resolution paths (auto-reply, gateway usage APIs, and session cost/log loaders) so non-default agents can resolve absolute session files without path-validation failures. (#15103) Thanks @jalehman.
- Sessions: archive previous transcript files on `/new` and `/reset` session resets (including gateway `sessions.reset`) so stale transcripts do not accumulate on disk. (#14869) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Status/Sessions: stop clamping derived `totalTokens` to context-window size, keep prompt-token snapshots wired through session accounting, and surface context usage as unknown when fresh snapshot data is missing to avoid false 100% reports. (#15114) Thanks @echoVic.
- Gateway/Routing: speed up hot paths for session listing (derived titles + previews), WS broadcast, and binding resolution.
- Gateway/Sessions: cache derived title + last-message transcript reads to speed up repeated sessions list refreshes.
- CLI/Completion: route plugin-load logs to stderr and write generated completion scripts directly to stdout to avoid `source <(openclaw completion ...)` corruption. (#15481) Thanks @arosstale.
- CLI: lazily load outbound provider dependencies and remove forced success-path exits so commands terminate naturally without killing intentional long-running foreground actions. (#12906) Thanks @DrCrinkle.
- CLI: speed up startup by lazily registering core commands (keeps rich `--help` while reducing cold-start overhead).
- Security/Gateway + ACP: block high-risk tools (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) from HTTP `/tools/invoke` by default with `gateway.tools.{allow,deny}` overrides, and harden ACP permission selection to fail closed when tool identity/options are ambiguous while supporting `allow_always`/`reject_always`. (#15390) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/ACP: prompt for non-read/search permission requests in ACP clients (reduces silent tool approval risk). Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Gateway: breaking default-behavior change - canvas IP-based auth fallback now only accepts machine-scoped addresses (RFC1918, link-local, ULA IPv6, CGNAT); public-source IP matches now require bearer token auth. (#14661) Thanks @sumleo.
- Security/Link understanding: block loopback/internal host patterns and private/mapped IPv6 addresses in extracted URL handling to close SSRF bypasses in link CLI flows. (#15604) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Security/Browser: constrain `POST /trace/stop`, `POST /wait/download`, and `POST /download` output paths to OpenClaw temp roots and reject traversal/escape paths.
- Security/Browser: sanitize download `suggestedFilename` to keep implicit `wait/download` paths within the downloads root. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: confine `POST /hooks/file-chooser` upload paths to an OpenClaw temp uploads root and reject traversal/escape paths. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Browser: require auth for the sandbox browser bridge server (protects `/profiles`, `/tabs`, CDP URLs, and other control endpoints). Thanks @jackhax.
- Security: bind local helper servers to loopback and fail closed on non-loopback OAuth callback hosts (reduces localhost/LAN attack surface).
- Security/Canvas: serve A2UI assets via the shared safe-open path (`openFileWithinRoot`) to close traversal/TOCTOU gaps, with traversal and symlink regression coverage. (#10525) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/WhatsApp: enforce `0o600` on `creds.json` and `creds.json.bak` on save/backup/restore paths to reduce credential file exposure. (#10529) Thanks @abdelsfane.
- Security/Gateway: sanitize and truncate untrusted WebSocket header values in pre-handshake close logs to reduce log-poisoning risk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Audit: add misconfiguration checks for sandbox Docker config with sandbox mode off, ineffective `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries, global minimal tool-profile overrides by agent profiles, and permissive extension-plugin tool reachability.
- Security/Audit: distinguish external webhooks (`hooks.enabled`) from internal hooks (`hooks.internal.enabled`) in attack-surface summaries to avoid false exposure signals when only internal hooks are enabled. (#13474) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Security/Onboarding: clarify multi-user DM isolation remediation with explicit `openclaw config set session.dmScope ...` commands in security audit, doctor security, and channel onboarding guidance. (#13129) Thanks @VintLin.
- Security/Gateway: bind node `system.run` approval overrides to gateway exec-approval records (runId-bound), preventing approval-bypass via `node.invoke` param injection. Thanks @222n5.
- Agents/Nodes: harden node exec approval decision handling in the `nodes` tool run path by failing closed on unexpected approval decisions, and add regression coverage for approval-required retry/deny/timeout flows. (#4726) Thanks @rmorse.
- Android/Nodes: harden `app.update` by requiring HTTPS and gateway-host URL matching plus SHA-256 verification, stream URL camera downloads to disk with size guards to avoid memory spikes, and stop signing release builds with debug keys. (#13541) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Routing: enforce strict binding-scope matching across peer/guild/team/roles so peer-scoped Discord/Slack bindings no longer match unrelated guild/team contexts or fallback tiers. (#15274) Thanks @lailoo.
- Exec/Allowlist: allow multiline heredoc bodies (`<<`, `<<-`) while keeping multiline non-heredoc shell commands blocked, so exec approval parsing permits heredoc input safely without allowing general newline command chaining. (#13811) Thanks @mcaxtr.
- Config: preserve `${VAR}` env references when writing config files so `openclaw config set/apply/patch` does not persist secrets to disk. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Config: remove a cross-request env-snapshot race in config writes by carrying read-time env context into write calls per request, preserving `${VAR}` refs safely under concurrent gateway config mutations. (#11560) Thanks @akoscz.
- Config: log overwrite audit entries (path, backup target, and hash transition) whenever an existing config file is replaced, improving traceability for unexpected config clobbers.
- Config: keep legacy audio transcription migration strict by rejecting non-string/unsafe command tokens while still migrating valid custom script executables. (#5042) Thanks @shayan919293.
- Config: accept `$schema` key in config file so JSON Schema editor tooling works without validation errors. (#14998)
- Gateway/Tools Invoke: sanitize `/tools/invoke` execution failures while preserving `400` for tool input errors and returning `500` for unexpected runtime failures, with regression coverage and docs updates. (#13185) Thanks @davidrudduck.
- Gateway/Hooks: preserve `408` for hook request-body timeout responses while keeping bounded auth-failure cache eviction behavior, with timeout-status regression coverage. (#15848) Thanks @AI-Reviewer-QS.
- Plugins/Hooks: fire `before_tool_call` hook exactly once per tool invocation in embedded runs by removing duplicate dispatch paths while preserving parameter mutation semantics. (#15635) Thanks @lailoo.
- Agents/Transcript policy: sanitize OpenAI/Codex tool-call ids during transcript policy normalization to prevent invalid tool-call identifiers from propagating into session history. (#15279) Thanks @divisonofficer.
- Agents/Image tool: cap image-analysis completion `maxTokens` by model capability (`min(4096, model.maxTokens)`) to avoid over-limit provider failures while still preventing truncation. (#11770) Thanks @detecti1.
- Agents/Compaction: centralize exec default resolution in the shared tool factory so per-agent `tools.exec` overrides (host/security/ask/node and related defaults) persist across compaction retries. (#15833) Thanks @napetrov.
- Gateway/Agents: stop injecting a phantom `main` agent into gateway agent listings when `agents.list` explicitly excludes it. (#11450) Thanks @arosstale.
- Process/Exec: avoid shell execution for `.exe` commands on Windows so env overrides work reliably in `runCommandWithTimeout`. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Daemon/Windows: preserve literal backslashes in `gateway.cmd` command parsing so drive and UNC paths are not corrupted in runtime checks and doctor entrypoint comparisons. (#15642) Thanks @arosstale.
- Sandbox: pass configured `sandbox.docker.env` variables to sandbox containers at `docker create` time. (#15138) Thanks @stevebot-alive.
- Voice Call: route webhook runtime event handling through shared manager event logic so rejected inbound hangups are idempotent in production, with regression tests for duplicate reject events and provider-call-ID remapping parity. (#15892) Thanks @dcantu96.
- Cron: add regression coverage for announce-mode isolated jobs so runs that already report `delivered: true` do not enqueue duplicate main-session relays, including delivery configs where `mode` is omitted and defaults to announce. (#15737) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Cron: honor `deleteAfterRun` in isolated announce delivery by mapping it to subagent announce cleanup mode, so cron run sessions configured for deletion are removed after completion. (#15368) Thanks @arosstale.
- Web tools/web_fetch: prefer `text/markdown` responses for Cloudflare Markdown for Agents, add `cf-markdown` extraction for markdown bodies, and redact fetched URLs in `x-markdown-tokens` debug logs to avoid leaking raw paths/query params. (#15376) Thanks @Yaxuan42.
- Tools/web_search: support `freshness` for the Perplexity provider by mapping `pd`/`pw`/`pm`/`py` to Perplexity `search_recency_filter` values and including freshness in the Perplexity cache key. (#15343) Thanks @echoVic.
- Clawdock: avoid Zsh readonly variable collisions in helper scripts. (#15501) Thanks @nkelner.
- Memory: switch default local embedding model to the QAT `embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0` variant for better quality at the same footprint. (#15429) Thanks @azade-c.
- Docs/Discord: expand quick setup and clarify guild workspace guidance. (#20088) Thanks @pejmanjohn, @thewilloftheshadow.
- Docs/Mermaid: remove hardcoded Mermaid init theme blocks from four docs diagrams so dark mode inherits readable theme defaults. (#15157) Thanks @heytulsiprasad.
- Security/Pairing: generate 256-bit base64url device and node pairing tokens and use byte-safe constant-time verification to avoid token-compare edge-case failures. (#16535) Thanks @FaizanKolega, @gumadeiras.

## 2026.2.12

### Changes

- CLI/Plugins: add `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` with `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--keep-files` options, including safe uninstall path handling and plugin uninstall docs. (#5985) Thanks @JustasMonkev.
- CLI: add `openclaw logs --local-time` to display log timestamps in local timezone. (#13818) Thanks @xialonglee.
- Telegram: render blockquotes as native `<blockquote>` tags instead of stripping them. (#14608)
- Telegram: expose `/compact` in the native command menu. (#10352) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Discord: add role-based allowlists and role-based agent routing. (#10650) Thanks @Minidoracat.
- Config: avoid redacting `maxTokens`-like fields during config snapshot redaction, preventing round-trip validation failures in `/config`. (#14006) Thanks @constansino.

### Breaking

- Hooks: `POST /hooks/agent` now rejects payload `sessionKey` overrides by default. To keep fixed hook context, set `hooks.defaultSessionKey` (recommended with `hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes: ["hook:"]`). If you need legacy behavior, explicitly set `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey: true`. Thanks @alpernae for reporting.

### Fixes

- Gateway/OpenResponses: harden URL-based `input_file`/`input_image` handling with explicit SSRF deny policy, hostname allowlists (`files.urlAllowlist` / `images.urlAllowlist`), per-request URL input caps (`maxUrlParts`), blocked-fetch audit logging, and regression coverage/docs updates.
- Sessions: guard `withSessionStoreLock` against undefined `storePath` to prevent `path.dirname` crash. (#14717)
- Security: fix unauthenticated Nostr profile API remote config tampering. (#13719) Thanks @coygeek.
- Security: remove bundled soul-evil hook. (#14757) Thanks @Imccccc.
- Security/Audit: add hook session-routing hardening checks (`hooks.defaultSessionKey`, `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey`, and prefix allowlists), and warn when HTTP API endpoints allow explicit session-key routing.
- Security/Sandbox: confine mirrored skill sync destinations to the sandbox `skills/` root and stop using frontmatter-controlled skill names as filesystem destination paths. Thanks @1seal.
- Security/Web tools: treat browser/web content as untrusted by default (wrapped outputs for browser snapshot/tabs/console and structured external-content metadata for web tools), and strip `toolResult.details` from model-facing transcript/compaction inputs to reduce prompt-injection replay risk.
- Security/Hooks: harden webhook and device token verification with shared constant-time secret comparison, and add per-client auth-failure throttling for hook endpoints (`429` + `Retry-After`). Thanks @akhmittra.

- Sandbox: add `openclaw sandbox explain` (effective policy inspector + fix-it keys); improve “sandbox jail” tool-policy/elevated errors with actionable config key paths; link to docs.
- Hooks/Gmail: keep Tailscale serve path at `/` while preserving the public path. (#668) — thanks @antons.
- Hooks/Gmail: allow Tailscale target URLs to preserve internal serve paths.

- Gateway/Control UI: allow `chat.abort` without `runId` (abort active runs), suppress post-abort chat streaming, and prune stuck chat runs. (#653)
- Gateway/Control UI: sniff image attachments for chat.send, drop non-images, and log mismatches. (#670) — thanks @cristip73.
- macOS: force `restart-mac.sh --sign` to require identities and keep bundled Node signed for relay verification. (#580) — thanks @jeffersonwarrior.
- Gateway/Agent: accept image attachments on `agent` (multimodal message) and add live gateway image probe (`CLAWDBOT_LIVE_GATEWAY_IMAGE_PROBE=1`).
- CLI: `openclaw sessions` now includes `elev:*` + `usage:*` flags in the table output.

- iOS/Android: enable stricter concurrency/lint checks; fix Swift 6 strict concurrency issues + Android lint errors (ExifInterface, obsolete SDK check). (#662) — thanks @KristijanJovanovski.
- Auth: read Codex CLI keychain tokens on macOS before falling back to `~/.codex/auth.json`, preventing stale refresh tokens from breaking gateway live tests.
- Security/Exec approvals: reject shell command substitution (`$()` and backticks) inside double quotes to prevent exec allowlist bypass when exec allowlist mode is explicitly enabled (the default configuration does not use this mode). Thanks @simecek.

This allows long-running agents to operate autonomously without manual re-authentication (#654 — thanks @radek-paclt).

## 2026.1.8

### Highlights

- Security: DMs locked down by default across providers; pairing-first + allowlist guidance.
- Sandbox: per-agent scope defaults + workspace access controls; tool/session isolation tuned.
- Agent loop: compaction, pruning, streaming, and error handling hardened.
- Providers: Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack reliability, threading, reactions, media, and retries improved.
- Control UI: logs tab, streaming stability, focus mode, and large-output rendering fixes.
- CLI/Gateway/Doctor: daemon/logs/status, auth migration, and diagnostics significantly expanded.

### Breaking

- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `openclaw pairing list <provider>` + `openclaw pairing approve <provider> <code>`.
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes

- **CLI/Gateway/Doctor:** daemon runtime selection + improved logs/status/health/errors; auth/password handling for local CLI; richer close/timeout details; auto-migrate legacy config/sessions/state; integrity checks + repair prompts; `--yes`/`--non-interactive`; `--deep` gateway scans; better restart/service hints.
- **Agent loop + compaction:** compaction/pruning tuning, overflow handling, safer bootstrap context, and per-provider threading/confirmations; opt-in tool-result pruning + compact tracking.
- **Sandbox + tools:** per-agent sandbox overrides, workspaceAccess controls, session tool visibility, tool policy overrides, process isolation, and tool schema/timeout/reaction unification.
- **Providers (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Signal/iMessage):** retry/backoff, threading, reactions, media groups/attachments, mention gating, typing behavior, and error/log stability; long polling + forum topic isolation for Telegram.
- **Gateway/CLI UX:** `openclaw logs`, cron list colors/aliases, docs search, agents list/add/delete flows, status usage snapshots, runtime/auth source display, and `/status`/commands auth unification.
- **Control UI/Web:** logs tab, focus mode polish, config form resilience, streaming stability, tool output caps, windowed chat history, and reconnect/password URL auth.
- **macOS/Android/TUI/Build:** macOS gateway races, QR bundling, JSON5 config safety, Voice Wake hardening; Android EXIF rotation + APK naming/versioning; TUI key handling; tooling/bundling fixes.
- **Packaging/compat:** npm dist folder coverage, Node 25 qrcode-terminal import fixes, Bun/Playwright/WebSocket patches, and Docker Bun install.
- **Docs:** new FAQ/ClawHub/config examples/showcase entries and clarified auth, sandbox, and systemd docs.

### Maintenance

- Skills additions (Himalaya email, CodexBar, 1Password).
- Dependency refreshes (pi-\* stack, Slack SDK, discord-api-types, file-type, zod, Biome, Vite).

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights

- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

### Fixes

- Control UI: render Markdown in tool result cards.
- Control UI: prevent overlapping action buttons in Discord guild rules on narrow layouts.
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids
- Cron tool uses `id` for update/remove/run/runs (aligns with gateway params). (#180) — thanks @adamgall
- Control UI: chat view uses page scroll with sticky header/sidebar and fixed composer (no inner scroll frame).
- macOS: treat location permission as always-only to avoid iOS-only enums. (#165) — thanks @Nachx639
- macOS: make generated gateway protocol models `Sendable` for Swift 6 strict concurrency. (#195) — thanks @andranik-sahakyan
- macOS: bundle QR code renderer modules so DMG gateway boot doesn't crash on missing qrcode-terminal vendor files.
- macOS: parse JSON5 config safely to avoid wiping user settings when comments are present.
- WhatsApp: suppress typing indicator during heartbeat background tasks. (#190) — thanks @mcinteerj
- WhatsApp: mark offline history sync messages as read without auto-reply. (#193) — thanks @mcinteerj
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when a provider emits late streaming `text_end` events (OpenAI/GPT).
- CLI: use tailnet IP for local gateway calls when bind is tailnet/auto (fixes #176).
- Env: load global `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.openclaw/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when OpenAI emits repeated `message_end` events.
- Commands: unify /status (inline) and command auth across providers; group bypass for authorized control commands; remove Discord /clawd slash handler.
- CLI: run `openclaw agent` via the Gateway by default; use `--local` to force embedded mode.
