- [ ] Full end-to-end QA and release hardening

## Open in Android Studio

- Open the folder `apps/android`.

## Build / Run

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:assemblePlayDebug
./gradlew :app:installPlayDebug
./gradlew :app:testPlayDebugUnitTest
cd ../..
bun run android:bundle:release
```

Third-party debug flavor:

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:assembleThirdPartyDebug
./gradlew :app:installThirdPartyDebug
./gradlew :app:testThirdPartyDebugUnitTest
```

`bun run android:bundle:release` auto-bumps Android `versionName`/`versionCode` in `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts`, then builds two signed release bundles:

- Play build: `apps/android/build/release-bundles/openclaw-<version>-play-release.aab`
- Third-party build: `apps/android/build/release-bundles/openclaw-<version>-third-party-release.aab`

Flavor-specific direct Gradle tasks:

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:bundlePlayRelease
./gradlew :app:bundleThirdPartyRelease
```

## Kotlin Lint + Format

```bash
pnpm android:lint
pnpm android:format
```

Android framework/resource lint (separate pass):

```bash
pnpm android:lint:android
```

Direct Gradle tasks:

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :app:ktlintCheck :benchmark:ktlintCheck
./gradlew :app:ktlintFormat :benchmark:ktlintFormat
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
```

`gradlew` auto-detects the Android SDK at `~/Library/Android/sdk` (macOS default) if `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` / `ANDROID_HOME` are unset.

## Macrobenchmark (Startup + Frame Timing)

```bash
cd apps/android
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Reports are written under:

- `apps/android/benchmark/build/reports/androidTests/connected/`

## Perf CLI (low-noise)

Deterministic startup measurement + hotspot extraction with compact CLI output:

```bash
cd apps/android
./scripts/perf-startup-benchmark.sh
./scripts/perf-startup-hotspots.sh
```

Benchmark script behavior:

- Runs only `StartupMacrobenchmark#coldStartup` (10 iterations).
- Prints median/min/max/COV in one line.
- Writes timestamped snapshot JSON to `apps/android/benchmark/results/`.
- Auto-compares with previous local snapshot (or pass explicit baseline: `--baseline <old-benchmarkData.json>`).

Hotspot script behavior:

- Ensures debug app installed, captures startup `simpleperf` data for `.MainActivity`.
- Prints top DSOs, top symbols, and key app-path clues (Compose/MainActivity/WebView).
- Writes raw `perf.data` path for deeper follow-up if needed.

## Run on a Real Android Phone (USB)

1) On phone, enable **Developer options** + **USB debugging**.
2) Connect by USB and accept the debugging trust prompt on phone.
3) Verify ADB can see the device:

```bash
adb devices -l
```

4) Install + launch debug build:

```bash
pnpm android:install
pnpm android:run
```

If `adb devices -l` shows `unauthorized`, re-plug and accept the trust prompt again.

### USB-only gateway testing (no LAN dependency)

Use `adb reverse` so Android `localhost:18789` tunnels to your laptop `localhost:18789`.

Terminal A (gateway):

```bash
pnpm openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

Terminal B (USB tunnel):

```bash
adb reverse tcp:18789 tcp:18789
```

Then in app **Connect → Manual**:

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `18789`
- TLS: off

## Hot Reload / Fast Iteration

This app is native Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.

- For Compose UI edits: use Android Studio **Live Edit** on a debug build (works on physical devices; project `minSdk=31` already meets API requirement).
- For many non-structural code/resource changes: use Android Studio **Apply Changes**.
- For structural/native/manifest/Gradle changes: do full reinstall (`pnpm android:run`).
- Canvas web content already supports live reload when loaded from Gateway `__openclaw__/canvas/` (see `docs/platforms/android.md`).

## Connect / Pair

1) Start the gateway (on your main machine):

```bash
pnpm openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

2) In the Android app:

- Open the **Connect** tab.
- Use **Setup Code** or **Manual** mode to connect.

3) Approve pairing (on the gateway machine):

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
```

More details: `docs/platforms/android.md`.

## Permissions

- Discovery:
  - Android 13+ (`API 33+`): `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`
  - Android 12 and below: `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (required for NSD scanning)
- Foreground service notification (Android 13+): `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
- Camera:
  - `CAMERA` for `camera.snap` and `camera.clip`
  - `RECORD_AUDIO` for `camera.clip` when `includeAudio=true`

## Google Play Restricted Permissions

As of March 19, 2026, these manifest permissions are the main Google Play policy risk for this app:

- `READ_SMS`
- `SEND_SMS`
- `READ_CALL_LOG`

Why these matter:

- Google Play treats SMS and Call Log access as highly restricted. In most cases, Play only allows them for the default SMS app, default Phone app, default Assistant, or a narrow policy exception.
- Review usually involves a `Permissions Declaration Form`, policy justification, and demo video evidence in Play Console.
- If we want a Play-safe build, these should be the first permissions removed behind a dedicated product flavor / variant.

Current OpenClaw Android implication:

- APK / sideload build can keep SMS and Call Log features.
- Google Play build should exclude SMS send/search and Call Log search unless the product is intentionally positioned and approved as a default-handler exception case.
- The repo now ships this split as Android product flavors:
  - `play`: removes `READ_SMS`, `SEND_SMS`, and `READ_CALL_LOG`, and hides SMS / Call Log surfaces in onboarding, settings, and advertised node capabilities.
  - `thirdParty`: keeps the full permission set and the existing SMS / Call Log functionality.

- [Android default handlers guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/default-handlers)

Other Play-restricted surfaces to watch if added later:

- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`
- `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`
- `AccessibilityService`

## Integration Capability Test (Preconditioned)

This suite assumes setup is already done manually. It does **not** install/run/pair automatically.

Pre-req checklist:

1) Gateway is running and reachable from the Android app.
2) Android app is connected to that gateway and `openclaw nodes status` shows it as paired + connected.
3) App stays unlocked and in foreground for the whole run.
4) Open the app **Screen** tab and keep it active during the run (canvas/A2UI commands require the canvas WebView attached there).
5) Grant runtime permissions for capabilities you expect to pass (camera/mic/location/notification listener/location, etc.).
6) No interactive system dialogs should be pending before test start.
7) Canvas host is enabled and reachable from the device (do not run gateway with `OPENCLAW_SKIP_CANVAS_HOST=1`; startup logs should include `canvas host mounted at .../__openclaw__/`).
8) Local operator test client pairing is approved. If first run fails with `pairing required`, approve latest pending device pairing request, then rerun:
9) For A2UI checks, keep the app on **Screen** tab; the node now auto-refreshes canvas capability once on first A2UI reachability failure (TTL-safe retry).

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve --latest
```

Run:

```bash
pnpm android:test:integration
```

Optional overrides:

- `OPENCLAW_ANDROID_GATEWAY_URL=ws://...` (default: from your local OpenClaw config)
- `OPENCLAW_ANDROID_GATEWAY_TOKEN=...`
- `OPENCLAW_ANDROID_GATEWAY_PASSWORD=...`
- `OPENCLAW_ANDROID_NODE_ID=...` or `OPENCLAW_ANDROID_NODE_NAME=...`

What it does:

- Reads `node.describe` command list from the selected Android node.
- Invokes advertised non-interactive commands.
- Skips `screen.record` in this suite (Android requires interactive per-invocation screen-capture consent).
- Asserts command contracts (success or expected deterministic error for safe-invalid calls like `sms.send` and `notifications.actions`).

Common failure quick-fixes:

- `pairing required` before tests start:
  - approve pending device pairing (`openclaw devices approve --latest`) and rerun.
- `A2UI host not reachable` / `A2UI_HOST_NOT_CONFIGURED`:
  - ensure gateway canvas host is running and reachable, keep the app on the **Screen** tab. The app will auto-refresh canvas capability once; if it still fails, reconnect app and rerun.
- `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE: canvas unavailable`:
  - app is not effectively ready for canvas commands; keep app foregrounded and **Screen** tab active.
