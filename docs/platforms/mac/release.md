# OpenClaw macOS release (Sparkle)

This app now ships Sparkle auto-updates. Release builds must be Developer ID–signed, zipped, and published with a signed appcast entry.

## Prereqs

- Developer ID Application cert installed (example: `Developer ID Application: <Developer Name> (<TEAMID>)`).
- Sparkle private key path set in the environment as `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` (path to your Sparkle ed25519 private key; public key baked into Info.plist). If it is missing, check `~/.profile`.
- Notary credentials (keychain profile or API key) for `xcrun notarytool` if you want Gatekeeper-safe DMG/zip distribution.
  - We use a Keychain profile named `openclaw-notary`, created from App Store Connect API key env vars in your shell profile:
    - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`
    - `echo "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8" | sed 's/\\n/\n/g' > /tmp/openclaw-notary.p8`
    - `xcrun notarytool store-credentials "openclaw-notary" --key /tmp/openclaw-notary.p8 --key-id "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID" --issuer "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID"`
- `pnpm` deps installed (`pnpm install --config.node-linker=hoisted`).
- Sparkle tools are fetched automatically via SwiftPM at `apps/macos/.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/` (`sign_update`, `generate_appcast`, etc.).

## Build & package

Notes:

- `APP_BUILD` maps to `CFBundleVersion`/`sparkle:version`; keep it numeric + monotonic (no `-beta`), or Sparkle compares it as equal.
- If `APP_BUILD` is omitted, `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` derives a Sparkle-safe default from `APP_VERSION` (`YYYYMMDDNN`: stable defaults to `90`, prereleases use a suffix-derived lane) and uses the higher of that value and git commit count.
- You can still override `APP_BUILD` explicitly when release engineering needs a specific monotonic value.
- Defaults to the current architecture (`$(uname -m)`). For release/universal builds, set `BUILD_ARCHS="arm64 x86_64"` (or `BUILD_ARCHS=all`).
- Use `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh` for release artifacts (zip + DMG + notarization). Use `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` for local/dev packaging.

```bash
# From repo root; set release IDs so Sparkle feed is enabled.
# APP_BUILD must be numeric + monotonic for Sparkle compare.
# Default is auto-derived from APP_VERSION when omitted.
BUNDLE_ID=ai.openclaw.mac \
APP_VERSION=2026.3.2 \
BUILD_CONFIG=release \
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: <Developer Name> (<TEAMID>)" \
scripts/package-mac-app.sh

# Zip for distribution (includes resource forks for Sparkle delta support)
ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent dist/OpenClaw.app dist/OpenClaw-2026.3.2.zip

# Optional: also build a styled DMG for humans (drag to /Applications)
scripts/create-dmg.sh dist/OpenClaw.app dist/OpenClaw-2026.3.2.dmg

# Recommended: build + notarize/staple zip + DMG
# First, create a keychain profile once:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "openclaw-notary" \
#     --apple-id "<apple-id>" --team-id "<team-id>" --password "<app-specific-password>"
NOTARIZE=1 NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE=openclaw-notary \
BUNDLE_ID=ai.openclaw.mac \
APP_VERSION=2026.3.2 \
BUILD_CONFIG=release \
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: <Developer Name> (<TEAMID>)" \
scripts/package-mac-dist.sh

# Optional: ship dSYM alongside the release
ditto -c -k --keepParent apps/macos/.build/release/OpenClaw.app.dSYM dist/OpenClaw-2026.3.2.dSYM.zip
```

## Appcast entry

Use the release note generator so Sparkle renders formatted HTML notes:

```bash
SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ed25519-private-key scripts/make_appcast.sh dist/OpenClaw-2026.3.2.zip https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/appcast.xml
```

Generates HTML release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` (via [`scripts/changelog-to-html.sh`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/scripts/changelog-to-html.sh)) and embeds them in the appcast entry.
Commit the updated `appcast.xml` alongside the release assets (zip + dSYM) when publishing.

## Publish & verify

- Upload `OpenClaw-2026.3.2.zip` (and `OpenClaw-2026.3.2.dSYM.zip`) to the GitHub release for tag `v2026.3.2`.
- Ensure the raw appcast URL matches the baked feed: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/appcast.xml`.
- Sanity checks:
  - `curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/appcast.xml` returns 200.
  - `curl -I <enclosure url>` returns 200 after assets upload.
  - On a previous public build, run “Check for Updates…” from the About tab and verify Sparkle installs the new build cleanly.

Definition of done: signed app + appcast are published, update flow works from an older installed version, and release assets are attached to the GitHub release.
