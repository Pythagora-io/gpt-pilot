# Authentication (Model Providers)

<Note>
This page covers **model provider** authentication (API keys, OAuth, and legacy Anthropic setup-token). For **gateway connection** authentication (token, password, trusted-proxy), see [Configuration](/gateway/configuration) and [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth).
</Note>

OpenClaw supports OAuth and API keys for model providers. For always-on gateway
hosts, API keys are usually the most predictable option. Subscription/OAuth
flows are also supported when they match your provider account model.

See [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth) for the full OAuth flow and storage
layout.
For SecretRef-based auth (`env`/`file`/`exec` providers), see [Secrets Management](/gateway/secrets).
For credential eligibility/reason-code rules used by `models status --probe`, see
[Auth Credential Semantics](/auth-credential-semantics).

## Recommended setup (API key, any provider)

If you’re running a long-lived gateway, start with an API key for your chosen
provider.
For Anthropic specifically, API key auth is the safe path. Anthropic
subscription-style auth inside OpenClaw is the legacy setup-token path and
should be treated as an **Extra Usage** path, not a plan-limits path.

1. Create an API key in your provider console.
2. Put it on the **gateway host** (the machine running `openclaw gateway`).

```bash
export <PROVIDER>_API_KEY="..."
openclaw models status
```

3. If the Gateway runs under systemd/launchd, prefer putting the key in
   `~/.openclaw/.env` so the daemon can read it:

```bash
cat >> ~/.openclaw/.env <<'EOF'
<PROVIDER>_API_KEY=...
EOF
```

Then restart the daemon (or restart your Gateway process) and re-check:

```bash
openclaw models status
openclaw doctor
```

If you’d rather not manage env vars yourself, onboarding can store
API keys for daemon use: `openclaw onboard`.

See [Help](/help) for details on env inheritance (`env.shellEnv`,
`~/.openclaw/.env`, systemd/launchd).

## Anthropic: legacy token compatibility

Anthropic setup-token auth is still available in OpenClaw as a
legacy/manual path. Anthropic's public Claude Code docs still cover direct
Claude Code terminal use under Claude plans, but Anthropic separately told
OpenClaw users that the **OpenClaw** Claude-login path counts as third-party
harness usage and requires **Extra Usage** billed separately from the
subscription.

For the clearest setup path, use an Anthropic API key. If you must keep a
subscription-style Anthropic path in OpenClaw, use the legacy setup-token path
with the expectation that Anthropic treats it as **Extra Usage**.

Manual token entry (any provider; writes `auth-profiles.json` + updates config):

```bash
openclaw models auth paste-token --provider openrouter
```

Auth profile refs are also supported for static credentials:

- `api_key` credentials can use `keyRef: { source, provider, id }`
- `token` credentials can use `tokenRef: { source, provider, id }`
- OAuth-mode profiles do not support SecretRef credentials; if `auth.profiles.<id>.mode` is set to `"oauth"`, SecretRef-backed `keyRef`/`tokenRef` input for that profile is rejected.

Automation-friendly check (exit `1` when expired/missing, `2` when expiring):

```bash
openclaw models status --check
```

Live auth probes:

```bash
openclaw models status --probe
```

Notes:

- Probe rows can come from auth profiles, env credentials, or `models.json`.
- If explicit `auth.order.<provider>` omits a stored profile, probe reports
  `excluded_by_auth_order` for that profile instead of trying it.
- If auth exists but OpenClaw cannot resolve a probeable model candidate for
  that provider, probe reports `status: no_model`.
- Rate-limit cooldowns can be model-scoped. A profile cooling down for one
  model can still be usable for a sibling model on the same provider.

Optional ops scripts (systemd/Termux) are documented here:
[Auth monitoring scripts](/help/scripts#auth-monitoring-scripts)

## Anthropic note

The Anthropic `claude-cli` backend was removed.

- Use Anthropic API keys for Anthropic traffic in OpenClaw.
- Anthropic setup-token remains a legacy/manual path and should be used with
  the Extra Usage billing expectation Anthropic communicated to OpenClaw users.
- `openclaw doctor` now detects stale removed Anthropic Claude CLI state. If
  stored credential bytes still exist, doctor converts them back into
  Anthropic token/OAuth profiles. If not, doctor removes the stale Claude CLI
  config and points you to API key or setup-token recovery.

## Checking model auth status

```bash
openclaw models status
openclaw doctor
```

## API key rotation behavior (gateway)

Some providers support retrying a request with alternative keys when an API call
hits a provider rate limit.

- Priority order:
  - `OPENCLAW_LIVE_<PROVIDER>_KEY` (single override)
  - `<PROVIDER>_API_KEYS`
  - `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`
  - `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY_*`
- Google providers also include `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as an additional fallback.
- The same key list is deduplicated before use.
- OpenClaw retries with the next key only for rate-limit errors (for example
  `429`, `rate_limit`, `quota`, `resource exhausted`, `Too many concurrent
requests`, `ThrottlingException`, `concurrency limit reached`, or
  `workers_ai ... quota limit exceeded`).
- Non-rate-limit errors are not retried with alternate keys.
- If all keys fail, the final error from the last attempt is returned.

## Controlling which credential is used

### Per-session (chat command)

Use `/model <alias-or-id>@<profileId>` to pin a specific provider credential for the current session (example profile ids: `anthropic:default`, `anthropic:work`).

Use `/model` (or `/model list`) for a compact picker; use `/model status` for the full view (candidates + next auth profile, plus provider endpoint details when configured).

### Per-agent (CLI override)

Set an explicit auth profile order override for an agent (stored in that agent’s `auth-profiles.json`):

```bash
openclaw models auth order get --provider anthropic
openclaw models auth order set --provider anthropic anthropic:default
openclaw models auth order clear --provider anthropic
```

Use `--agent <id>` to target a specific agent; omit it to use the configured default agent.
When you debug order issues, `openclaw models status --probe` shows omitted
stored profiles as `excluded_by_auth_order` instead of silently skipping them.
When you debug cooldown issues, remember that rate-limit cooldowns can be tied
to one model id rather than the whole provider profile.

## Troubleshooting

### "No credentials found"

If the Anthropic profile is missing, configure an Anthropic API key on the
**gateway host** or set up the legacy Anthropic setup-token path, then re-check:

```bash
openclaw models status
```

### Token expiring/expired

Run `openclaw models status` to confirm which profile is expiring. If a legacy
Anthropic token profile is missing or expired, refresh that setup via
setup-token or migrate to an Anthropic API key.

If the machine still has stale removed Anthropic Claude CLI state from older
builds, run:

```bash
openclaw doctor --yes
```

Doctor converts `anthropic:claude-cli` back to Anthropic token/OAuth when the
stored credential bytes still exist. Otherwise it removes stale Claude CLI
profile/config/model refs and leaves the next-step guidance.
