# Gateway protocol (WebSocket)

The Gateway WS protocol is the **single control plane + node transport** for
OpenClaw. All clients (CLI, web UI, macOS app, iOS/Android nodes, headless
nodes) connect over WebSocket and declare their **role** + **scope** at
handshake time.

## Transport

- WebSocket, text frames with JSON payloads.
- First frame **must** be a `connect` request.

## Handshake (connect)

Gateway → Client (pre-connect challenge):

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "connect.challenge",
  "payload": { "nonce": "…", "ts": 1737264000000 }
}
```

Client → Gateway:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "…",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3,
    "maxProtocol": 3,
    "client": {
      "id": "cli",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "platform": "macos",
      "mode": "operator"
    },
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"],
    "caps": [],
    "commands": [],
    "permissions": {},
    "auth": { "token": "…" },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "userAgent": "openclaw-cli/1.2.3",
    "device": {
      "id": "device_fingerprint",
      "publicKey": "…",
      "signature": "…",
      "signedAt": 1737264000000,
      "nonce": "…"
    }
  }
}
```

Gateway → Client:

```json
{
  "type": "res",
  "id": "…",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": { "type": "hello-ok", "protocol": 3, "policy": { "tickIntervalMs": 15000 } }
}
```

When a device token is issued, `hello-ok` also includes:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "deviceToken": "…",
    "role": "operator",
    "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write"]
  }
}
```

During trusted bootstrap handoff, `hello-ok.auth` may also include additional
bounded role entries in `deviceTokens`:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "deviceToken": "…",
    "role": "node",
    "scopes": [],
    "deviceTokens": [
      {
        "deviceToken": "…",
        "role": "operator",
        "scopes": ["operator.approvals", "operator.read", "operator.talk.secrets", "operator.write"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For the built-in node/operator bootstrap flow, the primary node token stays
`scopes: []` and any handed-off operator token stays bounded to the bootstrap
operator allowlist (`operator.approvals`, `operator.read`,
`operator.talk.secrets`, `operator.write`). Bootstrap scope checks stay
role-prefixed: operator entries only satisfy operator requests, and non-operator
roles still need scopes under their own role prefix.

### Node example

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "…",
  "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3,
    "maxProtocol": 3,
    "client": {
      "id": "ios-node",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "platform": "ios",
      "mode": "node"
    },
    "role": "node",
    "scopes": [],
    "caps": ["camera", "canvas", "screen", "location", "voice"],
    "commands": ["camera.snap", "canvas.navigate", "screen.record", "location.get"],
    "permissions": { "camera.capture": true, "screen.record": false },
    "auth": { "token": "…" },
    "locale": "en-US",
    "userAgent": "openclaw-ios/1.2.3",
    "device": {
      "id": "device_fingerprint",
      "publicKey": "…",
      "signature": "…",
      "signedAt": 1737264000000,
      "nonce": "…"
    }
  }
}
```

## Framing

- **Request**: `{type:"req", id, method, params}`
- **Response**: `{type:"res", id, ok, payload|error}`
- **Event**: `{type:"event", event, payload, seq?, stateVersion?}`

Side-effecting methods require **idempotency keys** (see schema).

## Roles + scopes

### Roles

- `operator` = control plane client (CLI/UI/automation).
- `node` = capability host (camera/screen/canvas/system.run).

### Scopes (operator)

Common scopes:

- `operator.read`
- `operator.write`
- `operator.admin`
- `operator.approvals`
- `operator.pairing`
- `operator.talk.secrets`

`talk.config` with `includeSecrets: true` requires `operator.talk.secrets`
(or `operator.admin`).

Plugin-registered gateway RPC methods may request their own operator scope, but
reserved core admin prefixes (`config.*`, `exec.approvals.*`, `wizard.*`,
`update.*`) always resolve to `operator.admin`.

Method scope is only the first gate. Some slash commands reached through
`chat.send` apply stricter command-level checks on top. For example, persistent
`/config set` and `/config unset` writes require `operator.admin`.

`node.pair.approve` also has an extra approval-time scope check on top of the
base method scope:

- commandless requests: `operator.pairing`
- requests with non-exec node commands: `operator.pairing` + `operator.write`
- requests that include `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, or `system.which`:
  `operator.pairing` + `operator.admin`

### Caps/commands/permissions (node)

Nodes declare capability claims at connect time:

- `caps`: high-level capability categories.
- `commands`: command allowlist for invoke.
- `permissions`: granular toggles (e.g. `screen.record`, `camera.capture`).

The Gateway treats these as **claims** and enforces server-side allowlists.

## Presence

- `system-presence` returns entries keyed by device identity.
- Presence entries include `deviceId`, `roles`, and `scopes` so UIs can show a single row per device
  even when it connects as both **operator** and **node**.

## Common RPC method families

This page is not a generated full dump, but the public WS surface is broader
than the handshake/auth examples above. These are the main method families the
Gateway exposes today.

`hello-ok.features.methods` is a conservative discovery list built from
`src/gateway/server-methods-list.ts` plus loaded plugin/channel method exports.
Treat it as feature discovery, not as a generated dump of every callable helper
implemented in `src/gateway/server-methods/*.ts`.

### System and identity

- `health` returns the cached or freshly probed gateway health snapshot.
- `status` returns the `/status`-style gateway summary; sensitive fields are
  included only for admin-scoped operator clients.
- `gateway.identity.get` returns the gateway device identity used by relay and
  pairing flows.
- `system-presence` returns the current presence snapshot for connected
  operator/node devices.
- `system-event` appends a system event and can update/broadcast presence
  context.
- `last-heartbeat` returns the latest persisted heartbeat event.
- `set-heartbeats` toggles heartbeat processing on the gateway.

### Models and usage

- `models.list` returns the runtime-allowed model catalog.
- `usage.status` returns provider usage windows/remaining quota summaries.
- `usage.cost` returns aggregated cost usage summaries for a date range.
- `doctor.memory.status` returns vector-memory / embedding readiness for the
  active default agent workspace.
- `sessions.usage` returns per-session usage summaries.
- `sessions.usage.timeseries` returns timeseries usage for one session.
- `sessions.usage.logs` returns usage log entries for one session.

### Channels and login helpers

- `channels.status` returns built-in + bundled channel/plugin status summaries.
- `channels.logout` logs out a specific channel/account where the channel
  supports logout.
- `web.login.start` starts a QR/web login flow for the current QR-capable web
  channel provider.
- `web.login.wait` waits for that QR/web login flow to complete and starts the
  channel on success.
- `push.test` sends a test APNs push to a registered iOS node.
- `voicewake.get` returns the stored wake-word triggers.
- `voicewake.set` updates wake-word triggers and broadcasts the change.

### Messaging and logs

- `send` is the direct outbound-delivery RPC for channel/account/thread-targeted
  sends outside the chat runner.
- `logs.tail` returns the configured gateway file-log tail with cursor/limit and
  max-byte controls.

### Talk and TTS

- `talk.config` returns the effective Talk config payload; `includeSecrets`
  requires `operator.talk.secrets` (or `operator.admin`).
- `talk.mode` sets/broadcasts the current Talk mode state for WebChat/Control UI
  clients.
- `talk.speak` synthesizes speech through the active Talk speech provider.
- `tts.status` returns TTS enabled state, active provider, fallback providers,
  and provider config state.
- `tts.providers` returns the visible TTS provider inventory.
- `tts.enable` and `tts.disable` toggle TTS prefs state.
- `tts.setProvider` updates the preferred TTS provider.
- `tts.convert` runs one-shot text-to-speech conversion.

### Secrets, config, update, and wizard

- `secrets.reload` re-resolves active SecretRefs and swaps runtime secret state
  only on full success.
- `secrets.resolve` resolves command-target secret assignments for a specific
  command/target set.
- `config.get` returns the current config snapshot and hash.
- `config.set` writes a validated config payload.
- `config.patch` merges a partial config update.
- `config.apply` validates + replaces the full config payload.
- `config.schema` returns the live config schema payload used by Control UI and
  CLI tooling: schema, `uiHints`, version, and generation metadata, including
  plugin + channel schema metadata when the runtime can load it. The schema
  includes field `title` / `description` metadata derived from the same labels
  and help text used by the UI, including nested object, wildcard, array-item,
  and `anyOf` / `oneOf` / `allOf` composition branches when matching field
  documentation exists.
- `config.schema.lookup` returns a path-scoped lookup payload for one config
  path: normalized path, a shallow schema node, matched hint + `hintPath`, and
  immediate child summaries for UI/CLI drill-down.
  - Lookup schema nodes keep the user-facing docs and common validation fields:
    `title`, `description`, `type`, `enum`, `const`, `format`, `pattern`,
    numeric/string/array/object bounds, and boolean flags like
    `additionalProperties`, `deprecated`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`.
  - Child summaries expose `key`, normalized `path`, `type`, `required`,
    `hasChildren`, plus the matched `hint` / `hintPath`.
- `update.run` runs the gateway update flow and schedules a restart only when
  the update itself succeeded.
- `wizard.start`, `wizard.next`, `wizard.status`, and `wizard.cancel` expose the
  onboarding wizard over WS RPC.

### Existing major families

#### Agent and workspace helpers

- `agents.list` returns configured agent entries.
- `agents.create`, `agents.update`, and `agents.delete` manage agent records and
  workspace wiring.
- `agents.files.list`, `agents.files.get`, and `agents.files.set` manage the
  bootstrap workspace files exposed for an agent.
- `agent.identity.get` returns the effective assistant identity for an agent or
  session.
- `agent.wait` waits for a run to finish and returns the terminal snapshot when
  available.

#### Session control

- `sessions.list` returns the current session index.
- `sessions.subscribe` and `sessions.unsubscribe` toggle session change event
  subscriptions for the current WS client.
- `sessions.messages.subscribe` and `sessions.messages.unsubscribe` toggle
  transcript/message event subscriptions for one session.
- `sessions.preview` returns bounded transcript previews for specific session
  keys.
- `sessions.resolve` resolves or canonicalizes a session target.
- `sessions.create` creates a new session entry.
- `sessions.send` sends a message into an existing session.
- `sessions.steer` is the interrupt-and-steer variant for an active session.

- `sessions.patch` updates session metadata/overrides.
- `sessions.reset`, `sessions.delete`, and `sessions.compact` perform session
  maintenance.
- `sessions.get` returns the full stored session row.
- chat execution still uses `chat.history`, `chat.send`, `chat.abort`, and
  `chat.inject`.
- `chat.history` is display-normalized for UI clients: inline directive tags are
  stripped from visible text, plain-text tool-call XML payloads (including
  `<tool_call>...</tool_call>`, `<function_call>...</function_call>`,
  `<tool_calls>...</tool_calls>`, `<function_calls>...</function_calls>`, and
  truncated tool-call blocks) and leaked ASCII/full-width model control tokens
  are stripped, pure silent-token assistant rows such as exact `NO_REPLY` /
  `no_reply` are omitted, and oversized rows can be replaced with placeholders.

#### Device pairing and device tokens

- `device.pair.list` returns pending and approved paired devices.
- `device.pair.approve`, `device.pair.reject`, and `device.pair.remove` manage
  device-pairing records.
- `device.token.rotate` rotates a paired device token within its approved role
  and scope bounds.
- `device.token.revoke` revokes a paired device token.

#### Node pairing, invoke, and pending work

- `node.pair.request`, `node.pair.list`, `node.pair.approve`,
  `node.pair.reject`, and `node.pair.verify` cover node pairing and bootstrap
  verification.
- `node.list` and `node.describe` return known/connected node state.
- `node.rename` updates a paired node label.
- `node.invoke` forwards a command to a connected node.
- `node.invoke.result` returns the result for an invoke request.
- `node.event` carries node-originated events back into the gateway.
- `node.canvas.capability.refresh` refreshes scoped canvas-capability tokens.
- `node.pending.pull` and `node.pending.ack` are the connected-node queue APIs.
- `node.pending.enqueue` and `node.pending.drain` manage durable pending work
  for offline/disconnected nodes.

#### Approval families

- `exec.approval.request`, `exec.approval.get`, `exec.approval.list`, and
  `exec.approval.resolve` cover one-shot exec approval requests plus pending
  approval lookup/replay.
- `exec.approval.waitDecision` waits on one pending exec approval and returns
  the final decision (or `null` on timeout).
- `exec.approvals.get` and `exec.approvals.set` manage gateway exec approval
  policy snapshots.
- `exec.approvals.node.get` and `exec.approvals.node.set` manage node-local exec
  approval policy via node relay commands.
- `plugin.approval.request`, `plugin.approval.list`,
  `plugin.approval.waitDecision`, and `plugin.approval.resolve` cover
  plugin-defined approval flows.

#### Other major families

- automation:
  - `wake` schedules an immediate or next-heartbeat wake text injection
  - `cron.list`, `cron.status`, `cron.add`, `cron.update`, `cron.remove`,
    `cron.run`, `cron.runs`
- skills/tools: `skills.*`, `tools.catalog`, `tools.effective`

### Common event families

- `chat`: UI chat updates such as `chat.inject` and other transcript-only chat
  events.
- `session.message` and `session.tool`: transcript/event-stream updates for a
  subscribed session.
- `sessions.changed`: session index or metadata changed.
- `presence`: system presence snapshot updates.
- `tick`: periodic keepalive / liveness event.
- `health`: gateway health snapshot update.
- `heartbeat`: heartbeat event stream update.
- `cron`: cron run/job change event.
- `shutdown`: gateway shutdown notification.
- `node.pair.requested` / `node.pair.resolved`: node pairing lifecycle.
- `node.invoke.request`: node invoke request broadcast.
- `device.pair.requested` / `device.pair.resolved`: paired-device lifecycle.
- `voicewake.changed`: wake-word trigger config changed.
- `exec.approval.requested` / `exec.approval.resolved`: exec approval
  lifecycle.
- `plugin.approval.requested` / `plugin.approval.resolved`: plugin approval
  lifecycle.

### Node helper methods

- Nodes may call `skills.bins` to fetch the current list of skill executables
  for auto-allow checks.

### Operator helper methods

- Operators may call `tools.catalog` (`operator.read`) to fetch the runtime tool catalog for an
  agent. The response includes grouped tools and provenance metadata:
  - `source`: `core` or `plugin`
  - `pluginId`: plugin owner when `source="plugin"`
  - `optional`: whether a plugin tool is optional
- Operators may call `tools.effective` (`operator.read`) to fetch the runtime-effective tool
  inventory for a session.
  - `sessionKey` is required.
  - The gateway derives trusted runtime context from the session server-side instead of accepting
    caller-supplied auth or delivery context.
  - The response is session-scoped and reflects what the active conversation can use right now,
    including core, plugin, and channel tools.
- Operators may call `skills.status` (`operator.read`) to fetch the visible
  skill inventory for an agent.
  - `agentId` is optional; omit it to read the default agent workspace.
  - The response includes eligibility, missing requirements, config checks, and
    sanitized install options without exposing raw secret values.
- Operators may call `skills.search` and `skills.detail` (`operator.read`) for
  ClawHub discovery metadata.
- Operators may call `skills.install` (`operator.admin`) in two modes:
  - ClawHub mode: `{ source: "clawhub", slug, version?, force? }` installs a
    skill folder into the default agent workspace `skills/` directory.
  - Gateway installer mode: `{ name, installId, dangerouslyForceUnsafeInstall?, timeoutMs? }`
    runs a declared `metadata.openclaw.install` action on the gateway host.
- Operators may call `skills.update` (`operator.admin`) in two modes:
  - ClawHub mode updates one tracked slug or all tracked ClawHub installs in
    the default agent workspace.
  - Config mode patches `skills.entries.<skillKey>` values such as `enabled`,
    `apiKey`, and `env`.

## Exec approvals

- When an exec request needs approval, the gateway broadcasts `exec.approval.requested`.
- Operator clients resolve by calling `exec.approval.resolve` (requires `operator.approvals` scope).
- For `host=node`, `exec.approval.request` must include `systemRunPlan` (canonical `argv`/`cwd`/`rawCommand`/session metadata). Requests missing `systemRunPlan` are rejected.
- After approval, forwarded `node.invoke system.run` calls reuse that canonical
  `systemRunPlan` as the authoritative command/cwd/session context.
- If a caller mutates `command`, `rawCommand`, `cwd`, `agentId`, or
  `sessionKey` between prepare and the final approved `system.run` forward, the
  gateway rejects the run instead of trusting the mutated payload.

## Agent delivery fallback

- `agent` requests can include `deliver=true` to request outbound delivery.
- `bestEffortDeliver=false` keeps strict behavior: unresolved or internal-only delivery targets return `INVALID_REQUEST`.
- `bestEffortDeliver=true` allows fallback to session-only execution when no external deliverable route can be resolved (for example internal/webchat sessions or ambiguous multi-channel configs).

## Versioning

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` lives in `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts`.
- Clients send `minProtocol` + `maxProtocol`; the server rejects mismatches.
- Schemas + models are generated from TypeBox definitions:
  - `pnpm protocol:gen`
  - `pnpm protocol:gen:swift`
  - `pnpm protocol:check`

## Auth

- Shared-secret gateway auth uses `connect.params.auth.token` or
  `connect.params.auth.password`, depending on the configured auth mode.
- Identity-bearing modes such as Tailscale Serve
  (`gateway.auth.allowTailscale: true`) or non-loopback
  `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` satisfy the connect auth check from
  request headers instead of `connect.params.auth.*`.
- Private-ingress `gateway.auth.mode: "none"` skips shared-secret connect auth
  entirely; do not expose that mode on public/untrusted ingress.
- After pairing, the Gateway issues a **device token** scoped to the connection
  role + scopes. It is returned in `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` and should be
  persisted by the client for future connects.
- Clients should persist the primary `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` after any
  successful connect.
- Reconnecting with that **stored** device token should also reuse the stored
  approved scope set for that token. This preserves read/probe/status access
  that was already granted and avoids silently collapsing reconnects to a
  narrower implicit admin-only scope.
- Normal connect auth precedence is explicit shared token/password first, then
  explicit `deviceToken`, then stored per-device token, then bootstrap token.
- Additional `hello-ok.auth.deviceTokens` entries are bootstrap handoff tokens.
  Persist them only when the connect used bootstrap auth on a trusted transport
  such as `wss://` or loopback/local pairing.
- If a client supplies an **explicit** `deviceToken` or explicit `scopes`, that
  caller-requested scope set remains authoritative; cached scopes are only
  reused when the client is reusing the stored per-device token.
- Device tokens can be rotated/revoked via `device.token.rotate` and
  `device.token.revoke` (requires `operator.pairing` scope).
- Token issuance/rotation stays bounded to the approved role set recorded in
  that device's pairing entry; rotating a token cannot expand the device into a
  role that pairing approval never granted.
- For paired-device token sessions, device management is self-scoped unless the
  caller also has `operator.admin`: non-admin callers can remove/revoke/rotate
  only their **own** device entry.
- `device.token.rotate` also checks the requested operator scope set against the
  caller's current session scopes. Non-admin callers cannot rotate a token into
  a broader operator scope set than they already hold.
- Auth failures include `error.details.code` plus recovery hints:
  - `error.details.canRetryWithDeviceToken` (boolean)
  - `error.details.recommendedNextStep` (`retry_with_device_token`, `update_auth_configuration`, `update_auth_credentials`, `wait_then_retry`, `review_auth_configuration`)
- Client behavior for `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH`:
  - Trusted clients may attempt one bounded retry with a cached per-device token.
  - If that retry fails, clients should stop automatic reconnect loops and surface operator action guidance.

## Device identity + pairing

- Nodes should include a stable device identity (`device.id`) derived from a
  keypair fingerprint.
- Gateways issue tokens per device + role.
- Pairing approvals are required for new device IDs unless local auto-approval
  is enabled.
- Pairing auto-approval is centered on direct local loopback connects.
- OpenClaw also has a narrow backend/container-local self-connect path for
  trusted shared-secret helper flows.
- Same-host tailnet or LAN connects are still treated as remote for pairing and
  require approval.
- All WS clients must include `device` identity during `connect` (operator + node).
  Control UI can omit it only in these modes:
  - `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth=true` for localhost-only insecure HTTP compatibility.
  - successful `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` operator Control UI auth.
  - `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth=true` (break-glass, severe security downgrade).
- All connections must sign the server-provided `connect.challenge` nonce.

### Device auth migration diagnostics

For legacy clients that still use pre-challenge signing behavior, `connect` now returns
`DEVICE_AUTH_*` detail codes under `error.details.code` with a stable `error.details.reason`.

Common migration failures:

| Message                     | details.code                     | details.reason           | Meaning                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `device nonce required`     | `DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_REQUIRED`     | `device-nonce-missing`   | Client omitted `device.nonce` (or sent blank).     |
| `device nonce mismatch`     | `DEVICE_AUTH_NONCE_MISMATCH`     | `device-nonce-mismatch`  | Client signed with a stale/wrong nonce.            |
| `device signature invalid`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_INVALID`  | `device-signature`       | Signature payload does not match v2 payload.       |
| `device signature expired`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_SIGNATURE_EXPIRED`  | `device-signature-stale` | Signed timestamp is outside allowed skew.          |
| `device identity mismatch`  | `DEVICE_AUTH_DEVICE_ID_MISMATCH` | `device-id-mismatch`     | `device.id` does not match public key fingerprint. |
| `device public key invalid` | `DEVICE_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY_INVALID` | `device-public-key`      | Public key format/canonicalization failed.         |

Migration target:

- Always wait for `connect.challenge`.
- Sign the v2 payload that includes the server nonce.
- Send the same nonce in `connect.params.device.nonce`.
- Preferred signature payload is `v3`, which binds `platform` and `deviceFamily`
  in addition to device/client/role/scopes/token/nonce fields.
- Legacy `v2` signatures remain accepted for compatibility, but paired-device
  metadata pinning still controls command policy on reconnect.

## TLS + pinning

- TLS is supported for WS connections.
- Clients may optionally pin the gateway cert fingerprint (see `gateway.tls`
  config plus `gateway.remote.tlsFingerprint` or CLI `--tls-fingerprint`).

## Scope

This protocol exposes the **full gateway API** (status, channels, models, chat,
agent, sessions, nodes, approvals, etc.). The exact surface is defined by the
TypeBox schemas in `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts`.
