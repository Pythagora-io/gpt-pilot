# Gateway troubleshooting

This page is the deep runbook.
Start at [/help/troubleshooting](/help/troubleshooting) if you want the fast triage flow first.

## Command ladder

Run these first, in this order:

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw gateway status
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
openclaw channels status --probe
```

Expected healthy signals:

- `openclaw gateway status` shows `Runtime: running` and `RPC probe: ok`.
- `openclaw doctor` reports no blocking config/service issues.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows live per-account transport status and,
  where supported, probe/audit results such as `works` or `audit ok`.

## Anthropic 429 extra usage required for long context

Use this when logs/errors include:
`HTTP 429: rate_limit_error: Extra usage is required for long context requests`.

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw models status
openclaw config get agents.defaults.models
```

Look for:

- Selected Anthropic Opus/Sonnet model has `params.context1m: true`.
- Current Anthropic credential is not eligible for long-context usage.
- Requests fail only on long sessions/model runs that need the 1M beta path.

Fix options:

1. Disable `context1m` for that model to fall back to the normal context window.
2. Use an Anthropic credential that is eligible for long-context requests, or switch to an Anthropic API key.
3. Configure fallback models so runs continue when Anthropic long-context requests are rejected.

## Local OpenAI-compatible backend passes direct probes but agent runs fail

Use this when:

- `curl ... /v1/models` works
- tiny direct `/v1/chat/completions` calls work
- OpenClaw model runs fail only on normal agent turns

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/models
curl http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<id>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
openclaw infer model run --model <provider/model> --prompt "hi" --json
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for:

- direct tiny calls succeed, but OpenClaw runs fail only on larger prompts
- backend errors about `messages[].content` expecting a string
- backend crashes that appear only with larger prompt-token counts or full agent
  runtime prompts

Common signatures:

- `messages[...].content: invalid type: sequence, expected a string` → backend
  rejects structured Chat Completions content parts. Fix: set
  `models.providers.<provider>.models[].compat.requiresStringContent: true`.
- direct tiny requests succeed, but OpenClaw agent runs fail with backend/model
  crashes (for example Gemma on some `inferrs` builds) → OpenClaw transport is
  likely already correct; the backend is failing on the larger agent-runtime
  prompt shape.
- failures shrink after disabling tools but do not disappear → tool schemas were
  part of the pressure, but the remaining issue is still upstream model/server
  capacity or a backend bug.

Fix options:

1. Set `compat.requiresStringContent: true` for string-only Chat Completions backends.
2. Set `compat.supportsTools: false` for models/backends that cannot handle
   OpenClaw's tool schema surface reliably.
3. Lower prompt pressure where possible: smaller workspace bootstrap, shorter
   session history, lighter local model, or a backend with stronger long-context
   support.
4. If tiny direct requests keep passing while OpenClaw agent turns still crash
   inside the backend, treat it as an upstream server/model limitation and file
   a repro there with the accepted payload shape.

## No replies

If channels are up but nothing answers, check routing and policy before reconnecting anything.

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
openclaw config get channels
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for:

- Pairing pending for DM senders.
- Group mention gating (`requireMention`, `mentionPatterns`).
- Channel/group allowlist mismatches.

Common signatures:

- `drop guild message (mention required` → group message ignored until mention.
- `pairing request` → sender needs approval.
- `blocked` / `allowlist` → sender/channel was filtered by policy.

## Dashboard control ui connectivity

When dashboard/control UI will not connect, validate URL, auth mode, and secure context assumptions.

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw status
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway status --json
```

Look for:

- Correct probe URL and dashboard URL.
- Auth mode/token mismatch between client and gateway.
- HTTP usage where device identity is required.

Common signatures:

- `device identity required` → non-secure context or missing device auth.
- `origin not allowed` → browser `Origin` is not in `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins`
  (or you are connecting from a non-loopback browser origin without an explicit
  allowlist).
- `device nonce required` / `device nonce mismatch` → client is not completing the
  challenge-based device auth flow (`connect.challenge` + `device.nonce`).
- `device signature invalid` / `device signature expired` → client signed the wrong
  payload (or stale timestamp) for the current handshake.
- `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH` with `canRetryWithDeviceToken=true` → client can do one trusted retry with cached device token.
- That cached-token retry reuses the cached scope set stored with the paired
  device token. Explicit `deviceToken` / explicit `scopes` callers keep their
  requested scope set instead.
- Outside that retry path, connect auth precedence is explicit shared
  token/password first, then explicit `deviceToken`, then stored device token,
  then bootstrap token.
- On the async Tailscale Serve Control UI path, failed attempts for the same
  `{scope, ip}` are serialized before the limiter records the failure. Two bad
  concurrent retries from the same client can therefore surface `retry later`
  on the second attempt instead of two plain mismatches.
- `too many failed authentication attempts (retry later)` from a browser-origin
  loopback client → repeated failures from that same normalized `Origin` are
  locked out temporarily; another localhost origin uses a separate bucket.
- repeated `unauthorized` after that retry → shared token/device token drift; refresh token config and re-approve/rotate device token if needed.
- `gateway connect failed:` → wrong host/port/url target.

### Auth detail codes quick map

Use `error.details.code` from the failed `connect` response to pick the next action:

| Detail code                  | Meaning                                                  | Recommended action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING`         | Client did not send a required shared token.             | Paste/set token in the client and retry. For dashboard paths: `openclaw config get gateway.auth.token` then paste into Control UI settings.                                                                                                                                              |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_MISMATCH`        | Shared token did not match gateway auth token.           | If `canRetryWithDeviceToken=true`, allow one trusted retry. Cached-token retries reuse stored approved scopes; explicit `deviceToken` / `scopes` callers keep requested scopes. If still failing, run the [token drift recovery checklist](/cli/devices#token-drift-recovery-checklist). |
| `AUTH_DEVICE_TOKEN_MISMATCH` | Cached per-device token is stale or revoked.             | Rotate/re-approve device token using [devices CLI](/cli/devices), then reconnect.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `PAIRING_REQUIRED`           | Device identity is known but not approved for this role. | Approve pending request: `openclaw devices list` then `openclaw devices approve <requestId>`.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Device auth v2 migration check:

```bash
openclaw --version
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway status
```

If logs show nonce/signature errors, update the connecting client and verify it:

1. waits for `connect.challenge`
2. signs the challenge-bound payload
3. sends `connect.params.device.nonce` with the same challenge nonce

If `openclaw devices rotate` / `revoke` / `remove` is denied unexpectedly:

- paired-device token sessions can manage only **their own** device unless the
  caller also has `operator.admin`
- `openclaw devices rotate --scope ...` can only request operator scopes that
  the caller session already holds

## Gateway service not running

Use this when service is installed but process does not stay up.

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw status
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway status --deep   # also scan system-level services
```

Look for:

- `Runtime: stopped` with exit hints.
- Service config mismatch (`Config (cli)` vs `Config (service)`).
- Port/listener conflicts.
- Extra launchd/systemd/schtasks installs when `--deep` is used.
- `Other gateway-like services detected (best effort)` cleanup hints.

Common signatures:

- `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local` or `existing config is missing gateway.mode` → local gateway mode is not enabled, or the config file was clobbered and lost `gateway.mode`. Fix: set `gateway.mode="local"` in your config, or re-run `openclaw onboard --mode local` / `openclaw setup` to restamp the expected local-mode config. If you are running OpenClaw via Podman, the default config path is `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
- `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → non-loopback bind without a valid gateway auth path (token/password, or trusted-proxy where configured).
- `another gateway instance is already listening` / `EADDRINUSE` → port conflict.
- `Other gateway-like services detected (best effort)` → stale or parallel launchd/systemd/schtasks units exist. Most setups should keep one gateway per machine; if you do need more than one, isolate ports + config/state/workspace. See [/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host](/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host).

## Gateway probe warnings

Use this when `openclaw gateway probe` reaches something, but still prints a warning block.

```bash
openclaw gateway probe
openclaw gateway probe --json
openclaw gateway probe --ssh user@gateway-host
```

Look for:

- `warnings[].code` and `primaryTargetId` in JSON output.
- Whether the warning is about SSH fallback, multiple gateways, missing scopes, or unresolved auth refs.

Common signatures:

- `SSH tunnel failed to start; falling back to direct probes.` → SSH setup failed, but the command still tried direct configured/loopback targets.
- `multiple reachable gateways detected` → more than one target answered. Usually this means an intentional multi-gateway setup or stale/duplicate listeners.
- `Probe diagnostics are limited by gateway scopes (missing operator.read)` → connect worked, but detail RPC is scope-limited; pair device identity or use credentials with `operator.read`.
- unresolved `gateway.auth.*` / `gateway.remote.*` SecretRef warning text → auth material was unavailable in this command path for the failed target.

## Channel connected messages not flowing

If channel state is connected but message flow is dead, focus on policy, permissions, and channel specific delivery rules.

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
openclaw status --deep
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw config get channels
```

Look for:

- DM policy (`pairing`, `allowlist`, `open`, `disabled`).
- Group allowlist and mention requirements.
- Missing channel API permissions/scopes.

Common signatures:

- `mention required` → message ignored by group mention policy.
- `pairing` / pending approval traces → sender is not approved.
- `missing_scope`, `not_in_channel`, `Forbidden`, `401/403` → channel auth/permissions issue.

## Cron and heartbeat delivery

If cron or heartbeat did not run or did not deliver, verify scheduler state first, then delivery target.

```bash
openclaw cron status
openclaw cron list
openclaw cron runs --id <jobId> --limit 20
openclaw system heartbeat last
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for:

- Cron enabled and next wake present.
- Job run history status (`ok`, `skipped`, `error`).
- Heartbeat skip reasons (`quiet-hours`, `requests-in-flight`, `alerts-disabled`, `empty-heartbeat-file`, `no-tasks-due`).

Common signatures:

- `cron: scheduler disabled; jobs will not run automatically` → cron disabled.
- `cron: timer tick failed` → scheduler tick failed; check file/log/runtime errors.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=quiet-hours` → outside active hours window.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=empty-heartbeat-file` → `HEARTBEAT.md` exists but only contains blank lines / markdown headers, so OpenClaw skips the model call.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=no-tasks-due` → `HEARTBEAT.md` contains a `tasks:` block, but none of the tasks are due on this tick.
- `heartbeat: unknown accountId` → invalid account id for heartbeat delivery target.
- `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=dm-blocked` → heartbeat target resolved to a DM-style destination while `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy` (or per-agent override) is set to `block`.

## Node paired tool fails

If a node is paired but tools fail, isolate foreground, permission, and approval state.

```bash
openclaw nodes status
openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw status
```

Look for:

- Node online with expected capabilities.
- OS permission grants for camera/mic/location/screen.
- Exec approvals and allowlist state.

Common signatures:

- `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE` → node app must be in foreground.
- `*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` / `LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` → missing OS permission.
- `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required` → exec approval pending.
- `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss` → command blocked by allowlist.

- [/nodes/index](/nodes/index)
- [/tools/exec-approvals](/tools/exec-approvals)

## Browser tool fails

Use this when browser tool actions fail even though the gateway itself is healthy.

```bash
openclaw browser status
openclaw browser start --browser-profile openclaw
openclaw browser profiles
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
```

Look for:

- Whether `plugins.allow` is set and includes `browser`.
- Valid browser executable path.
- CDP profile reachability.
- Local Chrome availability for `existing-session` / `user` profiles.

Common signatures:

- `unknown command "browser"` or `unknown command 'browser'` → the bundled browser plugin is excluded by `plugins.allow`.
- browser tool missing / unavailable while `browser.enabled=true` → `plugins.allow` excludes `browser`, so the plugin never loaded.
- `Failed to start Chrome CDP on port` → browser process failed to launch.
- `browser.executablePath not found` → configured path is invalid.
- `browser.cdpUrl must be http(s) or ws(s)` → the configured CDP URL uses an unsupported scheme such as `file:` or `ftp:`.
- `browser.cdpUrl has invalid port` → the configured CDP URL has a bad or out-of-range port.
- `No Chrome tabs found for profile="user"` → the Chrome MCP attach profile has no open local Chrome tabs.
- `Remote CDP for profile "<name>" is not reachable` → the configured remote CDP endpoint is not reachable from the gateway host.
- `Browser attachOnly is enabled ... not reachable` or `Browser attachOnly is enabled and CDP websocket ... is not reachable` → attach-only profile has no reachable target, or the HTTP endpoint answered but the CDP WebSocket still could not be opened.
- `Playwright is not available in this gateway build; '<feature>' is unsupported.` → the current gateway install lacks the full Playwright package; ARIA snapshots and basic page screenshots can still work, but navigation, AI snapshots, CSS-selector element screenshots, and PDF export stay unavailable.
- `fullPage is not supported for element screenshots` → screenshot request mixed `--full-page` with `--ref` or `--element`.
- `element screenshots are not supported for existing-session profiles; use ref from snapshot.` → Chrome MCP / `existing-session` screenshot calls must use page capture or a snapshot `--ref`, not CSS `--element`.
- `existing-session file uploads do not support element selectors; use ref/inputRef.` → Chrome MCP upload hooks need snapshot refs, not CSS selectors.
- `existing-session file uploads currently support one file at a time.` → send one upload per call on Chrome MCP profiles.
- `existing-session dialog handling does not support timeoutMs.` → dialog hooks on Chrome MCP profiles do not support timeout overrides.
- `response body is not supported for existing-session profiles yet.` → `responsebody` still requires a managed browser or raw CDP profile.
- stale viewport / dark-mode / locale / offline overrides on attach-only or remote CDP profiles → run `openclaw browser stop --browser-profile <name>` to close the active control session and release Playwright/CDP emulation state without restarting the whole gateway.

## If you upgraded and something suddenly broke

Most post-upgrade breakage is config drift or stricter defaults now being enforced.

### 1) Auth and URL override behavior changed

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw config get gateway.mode
openclaw config get gateway.remote.url
openclaw config get gateway.auth.mode
```

What to check:

- If `gateway.mode=remote`, CLI calls may be targeting remote while your local service is fine.
- Explicit `--url` calls do not fall back to stored credentials.

Common signatures:

- `gateway connect failed:` → wrong URL target.
- `unauthorized` → endpoint reachable but wrong auth.

### 2) Bind and auth guardrails are stricter

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.bind
openclaw config get gateway.auth.mode
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
openclaw gateway status
openclaw logs --follow
```

What to check:

- Non-loopback binds (`lan`, `tailnet`, `custom`) need a valid gateway auth path: shared token/password auth, or a correctly configured non-loopback `trusted-proxy` deployment.
- Old keys like `gateway.token` do not replace `gateway.auth.token`.

Common signatures:

- `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → non-loopback bind without a valid gateway auth path.
- `RPC probe: failed` while runtime is running → gateway alive but inaccessible with current auth/url.

### 3) Pairing and device identity state changed

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
```

What to check:

- Pending device approvals for dashboard/nodes.
- Pending DM pairing approvals after policy or identity changes.

Common signatures:

- `device identity required` → device auth not satisfied.
- `pairing required` → sender/device must be approved.

If the service config and runtime still disagree after checks, reinstall service metadata from the same profile/state directory:

```bash
openclaw gateway install --force
openclaw gateway restart
```
