# ClawDock

ClawDock is a small shell-helper layer for Docker-based OpenClaw installs.

It gives you short commands like `clawdock-start`, `clawdock-dashboard`, and `clawdock-fix-token` instead of longer `docker compose ...` invocations.

If you have not set up Docker yet, start with [Docker](/install/docker).

## Install

Use the canonical helper path:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.clawdock && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/scripts/clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh -o ~/.clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh
echo 'source ~/.clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

If you previously installed ClawDock from `scripts/shell-helpers/clawdock-helpers.sh`, reinstall from the new `scripts/clawdock/clawdock-helpers.sh` path. The old raw GitHub path was removed.

## What you get

### Utilities

| `clawdock-cd`          | Jump to the OpenClaw project directory  |
| `clawdock-config`      | Open `~/.openclaw`                      |
| `clawdock-show-config` | Print config files with redacted values |
| `clawdock-workspace`   | Open the workspace directory            |

## First-time flow

```bash
clawdock-start
clawdock-fix-token
clawdock-dashboard
```

If the browser says pairing is required:

```bash
clawdock-devices
clawdock-approve <request-id>
```

## Config and secrets

ClawDock works with the same Docker config split described in [Docker](/install/docker):

- `<project>/.env` for Docker-specific values like image name, ports, and the gateway token
- `~/.openclaw/.env` for env-backed provider keys and bot tokens
- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` for stored provider OAuth/API-key auth
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` for behavior config

Use `clawdock-show-config` when you want to inspect the `.env` files and `openclaw.json` quickly. It redacts `.env` values in its printed output.
