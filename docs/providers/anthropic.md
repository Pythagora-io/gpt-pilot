# Anthropic (Claude)

Anthropic builds the **Claude** model family and provides access via an API.
In OpenClaw, new Anthropic setup should use an API key. Existing legacy
Anthropic token profiles are still honored at runtime if they are already
configured.

<Warning>
For Anthropic in OpenClaw, the billing split is:

- **Anthropic API key**: normal Anthropic API billing.
- **Claude subscription auth inside OpenClaw**: Anthropic told OpenClaw users on
  **April 4, 2026 at 12:00 PM PT / 8:00 PM BST** that this counts as
  third-party harness usage and requires **Extra Usage** (pay-as-you-go,
  billed separately from the subscription).

Our local repros match that split:

- direct `claude -p` may still work
- `claude -p --append-system-prompt ...` can trip the Extra Usage guard when
  the prompt identifies OpenClaw
- the same OpenClaw-like system prompt does **not** reproduce the block on the
  Anthropic SDK + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` path

So the practical rule is: **Anthropic API key, or Claude subscription with
Extra Usage**. If you want the clearest production path, use an Anthropic API
key.

Anthropic's current public docs:

- [Claude Code CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference)
- [Claude Agent SDK overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)

- [Using Claude Code with your Pro or Max plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)
- [Using Claude Code with your Team or Enterprise plan](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11845131-using-claude-code-with-your-team-or-enterprise-plan/)

If you want the clearest billing path, use an Anthropic API key instead.
OpenClaw also supports other subscription-style options, including [OpenAI
Codex](/providers/openai), [Qwen Cloud Coding Plan](/providers/qwen),
[MiniMax Coding Plan](/providers/minimax), and [Z.AI / GLM Coding
Plan](/providers/glm).
</Warning>

## Option A: Anthropic API key

**Best for:** standard API access and usage-based billing.
Create your API key in the Anthropic Console.

### CLI setup

```bash
openclaw onboard
# choose: Anthropic API key

# or non-interactive
openclaw onboard --anthropic-api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

### Anthropic config snippet

```json5
{
  env: { ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-ant-..." },
  agents: { defaults: { model: { primary: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" } } },
}
```

## Thinking defaults (Claude 4.6)

- Anthropic Claude 4.6 models default to `adaptive` thinking in OpenClaw when no explicit thinking level is set.
- You can override per-message (`/think:<level>`) or in model params:
  `agents.defaults.models["anthropic/<model>"].params.thinking`.
- Related Anthropic docs:
  - [Adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking)
  - [Extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)

## Fast mode (Anthropic API)

OpenClaw's shared `/fast` toggle also supports direct public Anthropic traffic, including API-key and OAuth-authenticated requests sent to `api.anthropic.com`.

- `/fast on` maps to `service_tier: "auto"`
- `/fast off` maps to `service_tier: "standard_only"`
- Config default:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6": {
          params: { fastMode: true },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Important limits:

- OpenClaw only injects Anthropic service tiers for direct `api.anthropic.com` requests. If you route `anthropic/*` through a proxy or gateway, `/fast` leaves `service_tier` untouched.
- Explicit Anthropic `serviceTier` or `service_tier` model params override the `/fast` default when both are set.
- Anthropic reports the effective tier on the response under `usage.service_tier`. On accounts without Priority Tier capacity, `service_tier: "auto"` may still resolve to `standard`.

## Prompt caching (Anthropic API)

OpenClaw supports Anthropic's prompt caching feature. This is **API-only**; legacy Anthropic token auth does not honor cache settings.

### Configuration

Use the `cacheRetention` parameter in your model config:

| Value   | Cache Duration | Description              |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `none`  | No caching     | Disable prompt caching   |
| `short` | 5 minutes      | Default for API Key auth |
| `long`  | 1 hour         | Extended cache           |

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": {
          params: { cacheRetention: "long" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Defaults

When using Anthropic API Key authentication, OpenClaw automatically applies `cacheRetention: "short"` (5-minute cache) for all Anthropic models. You can override this by explicitly setting `cacheRetention` in your config.

### Per-agent cacheRetention overrides

Use model-level params as your baseline, then override specific agents via `agents.list[].params`.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" },
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": {
          params: { cacheRetention: "long" }, // baseline for most agents
        },
      },
    },
    list: [
      { id: "research", default: true },
      { id: "alerts", params: { cacheRetention: "none" } }, // override for this agent only
    ],
  },
}
```

Config merge order for cache-related params:

1. `agents.defaults.models["provider/model"].params`
2. `agents.list[].params` (matching `id`, overrides by key)

This lets one agent keep a long-lived cache while another agent on the same model disables caching to avoid write costs on bursty/low-reuse traffic.

### Bedrock Claude notes

- Anthropic Claude models on Bedrock (`amazon-bedrock/*anthropic.claude*`) accept `cacheRetention` pass-through when configured.
- Non-Anthropic Bedrock models are forced to `cacheRetention: "none"` at runtime.
- Anthropic API-key smart defaults also seed `cacheRetention: "short"` for Claude-on-Bedrock model refs when no explicit value is set.

## 1M context window (Anthropic beta)

Anthropic's 1M context window is beta-gated. In OpenClaw, enable it per model
with `params.context1m: true` for supported Opus/Sonnet models.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": {
          params: { context1m: true },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

OpenClaw maps this to `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07` on Anthropic
requests.

This only activates when `params.context1m` is explicitly set to `true` for
that model.

Requirement: Anthropic must allow long-context usage on that credential
(typically API key billing, or OpenClaw's Claude-login path / legacy token auth
with Extra Usage enabled). Otherwise Anthropic returns:
`HTTP 429: rate_limit_error: Extra usage is required for long context requests`.

Note: Anthropic currently rejects `context-1m-*` beta requests when using
legacy Anthropic token auth (`sk-ant-oat-*`). If you configure
`context1m: true` with that legacy auth mode, OpenClaw logs a warning and
falls back to the standard context window by skipping the context1m beta
header while keeping the required OAuth betas.

## Removed: Claude CLI backend

The bundled Anthropic `claude-cli` backend was removed.

- Anthropic's April 4, 2026 notice says OpenClaw-driven Claude-login traffic is
  third-party harness usage and requires **Extra Usage**.
- Our local repros also show that direct
  `claude -p --append-system-prompt ...` can hit the same guard when the
  appended prompt identifies OpenClaw.
- The same OpenClaw-like system prompt does not hit that guard on the
  Anthropic SDK + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` path.
- Use Anthropic API keys for Anthropic traffic in OpenClaw.

## Notes

- Anthropic's public Claude Code docs still document direct CLI usage such as
  `claude -p`, but Anthropic's separate notice to OpenClaw users says the
  **OpenClaw** Claude-login path is third-party harness usage and requires
  **Extra Usage** (pay-as-you-go billed separately from the subscription).
  Our local repros also show that direct
  `claude -p --append-system-prompt ...` can hit the same guard when the
  appended prompt identifies OpenClaw, while the same prompt shape does not
  reproduce on the Anthropic SDK + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` path. For production, we
  recommend Anthropic API keys instead.
- Anthropic setup-token is available again in OpenClaw as a legacy/manual path. Anthropic's OpenClaw-specific billing notice still applies, so use it with the expectation that Anthropic requires **Extra Usage** for this path.
- Auth details + reuse rules are in [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth).

## Troubleshooting

**401 errors / token suddenly invalid**

- Legacy Anthropic token auth can expire or be revoked.
- For new setup, migrate to an Anthropic API key.

**No API key found for provider "anthropic"**

- Auth is **per agent**. New agents don’t inherit the main agent’s keys.
- Re-run onboarding for that agent, or configure an API key on the gateway
  host, then verify with `openclaw models status`.

**No credentials found for profile `anthropic:default`**

- Run `openclaw models status` to see which auth profile is active.
- Re-run onboarding, or configure an API key for that profile path.

**No available auth profile (all in cooldown/unavailable)**

- Check `openclaw models status --json` for `auth.unusableProfiles`.
- Anthropic rate-limit cooldowns can be model-scoped, so a sibling Anthropic
  model may still be usable even when the current one is cooling down.
- Add another Anthropic profile or wait for cooldown.
