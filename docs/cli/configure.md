# `openclaw configure`

Interactive prompt to set up credentials, devices, and agent defaults.

Note: The **Model** section now includes a multi-select for the
`agents.defaults.models` allowlist (what shows up in `/model` and the model picker).

When configure starts from a provider auth choice, the default-model and
allowlist pickers prefer that provider automatically. For paired providers such
as Volcengine/BytePlus, the same preference also matches their coding-plan
variants (`volcengine-plan/*`, `byteplus-plan/*`). If the preferred-provider
filter would produce an empty list, configure falls back to the unfiltered
catalog instead of showing a blank picker.

Tip: `openclaw config` without a subcommand opens the same wizard. Use
`openclaw config get|set|unset` for non-interactive edits.

For web search, `openclaw configure --section web` lets you choose a provider
and configure its credentials. Some providers also show provider-specific
follow-up prompts:

- **Grok** can offer optional `x_search` setup with the same `XAI_API_KEY` and
  let you pick an `x_search` model.
- **Kimi** can ask for the Moonshot API region (`api.moonshot.ai` vs
  `api.moonshot.cn`) and the default Kimi web-search model.

## Options

- `--section <section>`: repeatable section filter

Available sections:

- `workspace`
- `model`
- `web`
- `gateway`
- `daemon`
- `channels`
- `plugins`
- `skills`
- `health`

Notes:

- Choosing where the Gateway runs always updates `gateway.mode`. You can select "Continue" without other sections if that is all you need.
- Channel-oriented services (Slack/Discord/Matrix/Microsoft Teams) prompt for channel/room allowlists during setup. You can enter names or IDs; the wizard resolves names to IDs when possible.
- If you run the daemon install step, token auth requires a token, and `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed, configure validates the SecretRef but does not persist resolved plaintext token values into supervisor service environment metadata.
- If token auth requires a token and the configured token SecretRef is unresolved, configure blocks daemon install with actionable remediation guidance.
- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, configure blocks daemon install until mode is set explicitly.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw configure
openclaw configure --section web
openclaw configure --section model --section channels
openclaw configure --section gateway --section daemon
```
