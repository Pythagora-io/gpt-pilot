# `openclaw configure`

Interactive prompt to set up credentials, devices, and agent defaults.

Note: The **Model** section now includes a multi-select for the
`agents.defaults.models` allowlist (what shows up in `/model` and the model picker).

Tip: `openclaw config` without a subcommand opens the same wizard. Use
`openclaw config get|set|unset` for non-interactive edits.

Notes:

- Choosing where the Gateway runs always updates `gateway.mode`. You can select "Continue" without other sections if that is all you need.
- Channel-oriented services (Slack/Discord/Matrix/Microsoft Teams) prompt for channel/room allowlists during setup. You can enter names or IDs; the wizard resolves names to IDs when possible.
- If you run the daemon install step, token auth requires a token, and `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed, configure validates the SecretRef but does not persist resolved plaintext token values into supervisor service environment metadata.
- If token auth requires a token and the configured token SecretRef is unresolved, configure blocks daemon install with actionable remediation guidance.
- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, configure blocks daemon install until mode is set explicitly.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw configure
openclaw configure --section model --section channels
```
