# `openclaw daemon`

Legacy alias for Gateway service management commands.

`openclaw daemon ...` maps to the same service control surface as `openclaw gateway ...` service commands.

## Usage

```bash
openclaw daemon status
openclaw daemon install
openclaw daemon start
openclaw daemon stop
openclaw daemon restart
openclaw daemon uninstall
```

## Subcommands

- `status`: show service install state and probe Gateway health
- `install`: install service (`launchd`/`systemd`/`schtasks`)
- `uninstall`: remove service
- `start`: start service
- `stop`: stop service
- `restart`: restart service

## Common options

- `status`: `--url`, `--token`, `--password`, `--timeout`, `--no-probe`, `--require-rpc`, `--deep`, `--json`
- `install`: `--port`, `--runtime <node|bun>`, `--token`, `--force`, `--json`
- lifecycle (`uninstall|start|stop|restart`): `--json`

Notes:

- `status` resolves configured auth SecretRefs for probe auth when possible.
- If a required auth SecretRef is unresolved in this command path, `daemon status --json` reports `rpc.authWarning` when probe connectivity/auth fails; pass `--token`/`--password` explicitly or resolve the secret source first.
- If the probe succeeds, unresolved auth-ref warnings are suppressed to avoid false positives.
- `status --deep` adds a best-effort system-level service scan. When it finds other gateway-like services, human output prints cleanup hints and warns that one gateway per machine is still the normal recommendation.
- On Linux systemd installs, `status` token-drift checks include both `Environment=` and `EnvironmentFile=` unit sources.
- Drift checks resolve `gateway.auth.token` SecretRefs using merged runtime env (service command env first, then process env fallback).
- If token auth is not effectively active (explicit `gateway.auth.mode` of `password`/`none`/`trusted-proxy`, or mode unset where password can win and no token candidate can win), token-drift checks skip config token resolution.
- When token auth requires a token and `gateway.auth.token` is SecretRef-managed, `install` validates that the SecretRef is resolvable but does not persist the resolved token into service environment metadata.
- If token auth requires a token and the configured token SecretRef is unresolved, install fails closed.
- If both `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.auth.password` are configured and `gateway.auth.mode` is unset, install is blocked until mode is set explicitly.
- If you intentionally run multiple gateways on one host, isolate ports, config/state, and workspaces; see [/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host](/gateway#multiple-gateways-same-host).
