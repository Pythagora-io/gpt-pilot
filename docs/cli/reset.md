# `openclaw reset`

Reset local config/state (keeps the CLI installed).

```bash
openclaw backup create
openclaw reset
openclaw reset --dry-run
openclaw reset --scope config+creds+sessions --yes --non-interactive
```

Run `openclaw backup create` first if you want a restorable snapshot before removing local state.
