# Onboarding Overview

OpenClaw has two onboarding paths. Both configure auth, the Gateway, and
optional chat channels — they just differ in how you interact with the setup.

## Which path should I use?

|                | CLI onboarding                         | macOS app onboarding      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Platforms**  | macOS, Linux, Windows (native or WSL2) | macOS only                |
| **Interface**  | Terminal wizard                        | Guided UI in the app      |
| **Best for**   | Servers, headless, full control        | Desktop Mac, visual setup |
| **Automation** | `--non-interactive` for scripts        | Manual only               |
| **Command**    | `openclaw onboard`                     | Launch the app            |

Most users should start with **CLI onboarding** — it works everywhere and gives
you the most control.

## What onboarding configures

Regardless of which path you choose, onboarding sets up:

1. **Model provider and auth** — API key, OAuth, or setup token for your chosen provider
2. **Workspace** — directory for agent files, bootstrap templates, and memory
3. **Gateway** — port, bind address, auth mode
4. **Channels** (optional) — built-in and bundled chat channels such as
   BlueBubbles, Discord, Feishu, Google Chat, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams,
   Telegram, WhatsApp, and more
5. **Daemon** (optional) — background service so the Gateway starts automatically

## CLI onboarding

Run in any terminal:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Add `--install-daemon` to also install the background service in one step.

## macOS app onboarding

Open the OpenClaw app. The first-run wizard walks you through the same steps
with a visual interface.

## Custom or unlisted providers

If your provider is not listed in onboarding, choose **Custom Provider** and
enter:

- API compatibility mode (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or auto-detect)
- Base URL and API key
- Model ID and optional alias

Multiple custom endpoints can coexist — each gets its own endpoint ID.
