# Getting Started

Install OpenClaw, run onboarding, and chat with your AI assistant — all in
about 5 minutes. By the end you will have a running Gateway, configured auth,
and a working chat session.

## What you need

- **Node.js** — Node 24 recommended (Node 22.14+ also supported)
- **An API key** from a model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) — onboarding will prompt you

<Tip>
Check your Node version with `node --version`.
**Windows users:** both native Windows and WSL2 are supported. WSL2 is more
stable and recommended for the full experience. See [Windows](/platforms/windows).
Need to install Node? See [Node setup](/install/node).
</Tip>

## Quick setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install OpenClaw">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
        ```
        <img
  src="/assets/install-script.svg"
  alt="Install Script Process"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
        ```powershell
        iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Note>
    Other install methods (Docker, Nix, npm): [Install](/install).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run onboarding">
    ```bash
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```

    The wizard walks you through choosing a model provider, setting an API key,
    and configuring the Gateway. It takes about 2 minutes.

    See [Onboarding (CLI)](/start/wizard) for the full reference.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the Gateway is running">
    ```bash
    openclaw gateway status
    ```

    You should see the Gateway listening on port 18789.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the dashboard">
    ```bash
    openclaw dashboard
    ```

    This opens the Control UI in your browser. If it loads, everything is working.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send your first message">
    Type a message in the Control UI chat and you should get an AI reply.

    Want to chat from your phone instead? The fastest channel to set up is
    [Telegram](/channels/telegram) (just a bot token). See [Channels](/channels)
    for all options.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Advanced: mount a custom Control UI build">
  If you maintain a localized or customized dashboard build, point
  `gateway.controlUi.root` to a directory that contains your built static
  assets and `index.html`.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.openclaw/control-ui-custom"
# Copy your built static files into that directory.
```

Then set:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "controlUi": {
      "enabled": true,
      "root": "$HOME/.openclaw/control-ui-custom"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway and reopen the dashboard:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw dashboard
```

</Accordion>
