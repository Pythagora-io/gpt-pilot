# Elevated Mode

When an agent runs inside a sandbox, its `exec` commands are confined to the
sandbox environment. **Elevated mode** lets the agent break out and run commands
on the gateway host instead, with configurable approval gates.

<Info>
  Elevated mode only changes behavior when the agent is **sandboxed**. For
  unsandboxed agents, exec already runs on the host.
</Info>

## Directives

Control elevated mode per-session with slash commands:

| Directive        | What it does                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `/elevated on`   | Run on the gateway host, keep exec approvals        |
| `/elevated ask`  | Same as `on` (alias)                                |
| `/elevated full` | Run on the gateway host **and** skip exec approvals |
| `/elevated off`  | Return to sandbox-confined execution                |

Also available as `/elev on|off|ask|full`.

Send `/elevated` with no argument to see the current level.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check availability">
    Elevated must be enabled in config and the sender must be on the allowlist:

    ```json5
    {
      tools: {
        elevated: {
          enabled: true,
          allowFrom: {
            discord: ["user-id-123"],
            whatsapp: ["+15555550123"],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the level">
    Send a directive-only message to set the session default:

    ```
    /elevated full
    ```

    Or use it inline (applies to that message only):

    ```
    /elevated on run the deployment script
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Commands run on the host">
    With elevated active, `exec` calls route to the gateway host instead of the
    sandbox. In `full` mode, exec approvals are skipped. In `on`/`ask` mode,
    configured approval rules still apply.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolution order

1. **Inline directive** on the message (applies only to that message)
2. **Session override** (set by sending a directive-only message)
3. **Global default** (`agents.defaults.elevatedDefault` in config)

## Availability and allowlists

- **Global gate**: `tools.elevated.enabled` (must be `true`)
- **Sender allowlist**: `tools.elevated.allowFrom` with per-channel lists
- **Per-agent gate**: `agents.list[].tools.elevated.enabled` (can only further restrict)
- **Per-agent allowlist**: `agents.list[].tools.elevated.allowFrom` (sender must match both global + per-agent)
- **Discord fallback**: if `tools.elevated.allowFrom.discord` is omitted, `channels.discord.allowFrom` is used as fallback
- **All gates must pass**; otherwise elevated is treated as unavailable

Allowlist entry formats:

| Prefix                  | Matches                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| (none)                  | Sender ID, E.164, or From field |
| `name:`                 | Sender display name             |
| `username:`             | Sender username                 |
| `tag:`                  | Sender tag                      |
| `id:`, `from:`, `e164:` | Explicit identity targeting     |

## What elevated does not control

- **Tool policy**: if `exec` is denied by tool policy, elevated cannot override it
- **Separate from `/exec`**: the `/exec` directive adjusts per-session exec defaults for authorized senders and does not require elevated mode
