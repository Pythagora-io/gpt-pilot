# Code Execution

`code_execution` runs sandboxed remote Python analysis on xAI's Responses API.
This is different from local [`exec`](/tools/exec):

- `exec` runs shell commands on your machine or node
- `code_execution` runs Python in xAI's remote sandbox

Use `code_execution` for:

- calculations
- tabulation
- quick statistics
- chart-style analysis
- analyzing data returned by `x_search` or `web_search`

Do **not** use it when you need local files, your shell, your repo, or paired
devices. Use [`exec`](/tools/exec) for that.

## Setup

You need an xAI API key. Any of these work:

- `XAI_API_KEY`
- `plugins.entries.xai.config.webSearch.apiKey`

Example:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      xai: {
        config: {
          webSearch: {
            apiKey: "xai-...",
          },
          codeExecution: {
            enabled: true,
            model: "grok-4-1-fast",
            maxTurns: 2,
            timeoutSeconds: 30,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## How To Use It

Ask naturally and make the analysis intent explicit:

```text
Use code_execution to calculate the 7-day moving average for these numbers: ...
```

```text
Use x_search to find posts mentioning OpenClaw this week, then use code_execution to count them by day.
```

```text
Use web_search to gather the latest AI benchmark numbers, then use code_execution to compare percent changes.
```

The tool takes a single `task` parameter internally, so the agent should send
the full analysis request and any inline data in one prompt.

## Limits

- This is remote xAI execution, not local process execution.
- It should be treated as ephemeral analysis, not a persistent notebook.
- Do not assume access to local files or your workspace.
- For fresh X data, use [`x_search`](/tools/web#x_search) first.
