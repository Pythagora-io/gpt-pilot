# Plugin Setup and Config

Reference for plugin packaging (`package.json` metadata), manifests
(`openclaw.plugin.json`), setup entries, and config schemas.

<Tip>
  **Looking for a walkthrough?** The how-to guides cover packaging in context:
  [Channel Plugins](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins#step-1-package-and-manifest) and
  [Provider Plugins](/plugins/sdk-provider-plugins#step-1-package-and-manifest).
</Tip>

## Package metadata

Your `package.json` needs an `openclaw` field that tells the plugin system what
your plugin provides:

**Channel plugin:**

```json
{
  "name": "@myorg/openclaw-my-channel",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./index.ts"],
    "setupEntry": "./setup-entry.ts",
    "channel": {
      "id": "my-channel",
      "label": "My Channel",
      "blurb": "Short description of the channel."
    }
  }
}
```

**Provider plugin / ClawHub publish baseline:**

```json openclaw-clawhub-package.json
{
  "name": "@myorg/openclaw-my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./index.ts"],
    "compat": {
      "pluginApi": ">=2026.3.24-beta.2",
      "minGatewayVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2"
    },
    "build": {
      "openclawVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2",
      "pluginSdkVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2"
    }
  }
}
```

If you publish the plugin externally on ClawHub, those `compat` and `build`
fields are required. The canonical publish snippets live in
`docs/snippets/plugin-publish/`.

### `openclaw` fields

| Field        | Type       | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `extensions` | `string[]` | Entry point files (relative to package root)                                                           |
| `setupEntry` | `string`   | Lightweight setup-only entry (optional)                                                                |
| `channel`    | `object`   | Channel catalog metadata for setup, picker, quickstart, and status surfaces                            |
| `providers`  | `string[]` | Provider ids registered by this plugin                                                                 |
| `install`    | `object`   | Install hints: `npmSpec`, `localPath`, `defaultChoice`, `minHostVersion`, `allowInvalidConfigRecovery` |
| `startup`    | `object`   | Startup behavior flags                                                                                 |

### `openclaw.channel`

`openclaw.channel` is cheap package metadata for channel discovery and setup
surfaces before runtime loads.

| Field                                  | Type       | What it means                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                                   | `string`   | Canonical channel id.                                                         |
| `label`                                | `string`   | Primary channel label.                                                        |
| `selectionLabel`                       | `string`   | Picker/setup label when it should differ from `label`.                        |
| `detailLabel`                          | `string`   | Secondary detail label for richer channel catalogs and status surfaces.       |
| `docsPath`                             | `string`   | Docs path for setup and selection links.                                      |
| `docsLabel`                            | `string`   | Override label used for docs links when it should differ from the channel id. |
| `blurb`                                | `string`   | Short onboarding/catalog description.                                         |
| `order`                                | `number`   | Sort order in channel catalogs.                                               |
| `aliases`                              | `string[]` | Extra lookup aliases for channel selection.                                   |
| `preferOver`                           | `string[]` | Lower-priority plugin/channel ids this channel should outrank.                |
| `systemImage`                          | `string`   | Optional icon/system-image name for channel UI catalogs.                      |
| `selectionDocsPrefix`                  | `string`   | Prefix text before docs links in selection surfaces.                          |
| `selectionDocsOmitLabel`               | `boolean`  | Show the docs path directly instead of a labeled docs link in selection copy. |
| `selectionExtras`                      | `string[]` | Extra short strings appended in selection copy.                               |
| `markdownCapable`                      | `boolean`  | Marks the channel as markdown-capable for outbound formatting decisions.      |
| `exposure`                             | `object`   | Channel visibility controls for setup, configured lists, and docs surfaces.   |
| `quickstartAllowFrom`                  | `boolean`  | Opt this channel into the standard quickstart `allowFrom` setup flow.         |
| `forceAccountBinding`                  | `boolean`  | Require explicit account binding even when only one account exists.           |
| `preferSessionLookupForAnnounceTarget` | `boolean`  | Prefer session lookup when resolving announce targets for this channel.       |

Example:

```json
{
  "openclaw": {
    "channel": {
      "id": "my-channel",
      "label": "My Channel",
      "selectionLabel": "My Channel (self-hosted)",
      "detailLabel": "My Channel Bot",
      "docsPath": "/channels/my-channel",
      "docsLabel": "my-channel",
      "blurb": "Webhook-based self-hosted chat integration.",
      "order": 80,
      "aliases": ["mc"],
      "preferOver": ["my-channel-legacy"],
      "selectionDocsPrefix": "Guide:",
      "selectionExtras": ["Markdown"],
      "markdownCapable": true,
      "exposure": {
        "configured": true,
        "setup": true,
        "docs": true
      },
      "quickstartAllowFrom": true
    }
  }
}
```

`exposure` supports:

- `configured`: include the channel in configured/status-style listing surfaces
- `setup`: include the channel in interactive setup/configure pickers
- `docs`: mark the channel as public-facing in docs/navigation surfaces

`showConfigured` and `showInSetup` remain supported as legacy aliases. Prefer
`exposure`.

### `openclaw.install`

`openclaw.install` is package metadata, not manifest metadata.

| Field                        | Type                 | What it means                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npmSpec`                    | `string`             | Canonical npm spec for install/update flows.                                     |
| `localPath`                  | `string`             | Local development or bundled install path.                                       |
| `defaultChoice`              | `"npm"` \| `"local"` | Preferred install source when both are available.                                |
| `minHostVersion`             | `string`             | Minimum supported OpenClaw version in the form `>=x.y.z`.                        |
| `allowInvalidConfigRecovery` | `boolean`            | Lets bundled-plugin reinstall flows recover from specific stale-config failures. |

If `minHostVersion` is set, install and manifest-registry loading both enforce
it. Older hosts skip the plugin; invalid version strings are rejected.

`allowInvalidConfigRecovery` is not a general bypass for broken configs. It is
for narrow bundled-plugin recovery only, so reinstall/setup can repair known
upgrade leftovers like a missing bundled plugin path or stale `channels.<id>`
entry for that same plugin. If config is broken for unrelated reasons, install
still fails closed and tells the operator to run `openclaw doctor --fix`.

### Deferred full load

Channel plugins can opt into deferred loading with:

```json
{
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./index.ts"],
    "setupEntry": "./setup-entry.ts",
    "startup": {
      "deferConfiguredChannelFullLoadUntilAfterListen": true
    }
  }
}
```

When enabled, OpenClaw loads only `setupEntry` during the pre-listen startup
phase, even for already-configured channels. The full entry loads after the
gateway starts listening.

<Warning>
  Only enable deferred loading when your `setupEntry` registers everything the
  gateway needs before it starts listening (channel registration, HTTP routes,
  gateway methods). If the full entry owns required startup capabilities, keep
  the default behavior.
</Warning>

If your setup/full entry registers gateway RPC methods, keep them on a
plugin-specific prefix. Reserved core admin namespaces (`config.*`,
`exec.approvals.*`, `wizard.*`, `update.*`) stay core-owned and always resolve
to `operator.admin`.

## Plugin manifest

Every native plugin must ship an `openclaw.plugin.json` in the package root.
OpenClaw uses this to validate config without executing plugin code.

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "description": "Adds My Plugin capabilities to OpenClaw",
  "configSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {
      "webhookSecret": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Webhook verification secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For channel plugins, add `kind` and `channels`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-channel",
  "kind": "channel",
  "channels": ["my-channel"],
  "configSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {}
  }
}
```

Even plugins with no config must ship a schema. An empty schema is valid:

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "configSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

See [Plugin Manifest](/plugins/manifest) for the full schema reference.

## ClawHub publishing

For plugin packages, use the package-specific ClawHub command:

```bash
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin
```

The legacy skill-only publish alias is for skills. Plugin packages should
always use `clawhub package publish`.

## Setup entry

The `setup-entry.ts` file is a lightweight alternative to `index.ts` that
OpenClaw loads when it only needs setup surfaces (onboarding, config repair,
disabled channel inspection).

```typescript
// setup-entry.ts
import { defineSetupPluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-core";
import { myChannelPlugin } from "./src/channel.js";

export default defineSetupPluginEntry(myChannelPlugin);
```

This avoids loading heavy runtime code (crypto libraries, CLI registrations,
background services) during setup flows.

**When OpenClaw uses `setupEntry` instead of the full entry:**

- The channel is disabled but needs setup/onboarding surfaces
- The channel is enabled but unconfigured
- Deferred loading is enabled (`deferConfiguredChannelFullLoadUntilAfterListen`)

**What `setupEntry` must register:**

- The channel plugin object (via `defineSetupPluginEntry`)
- Any HTTP routes required before gateway listen
- Any gateway methods needed during startup

Those startup gateway methods should still avoid reserved core admin
namespaces such as `config.*` or `update.*`.

**What `setupEntry` should NOT include:**

- CLI registrations
- Background services
- Heavy runtime imports (crypto, SDKs)
- Gateway methods only needed after startup

### Narrow setup helper imports

For hot setup-only paths, prefer the narrow setup helper seams over the broader
`plugin-sdk/setup` umbrella when you only need part of the setup surface:

| Import path                        | Use it for                                                                                | Key exports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin-sdk/setup-runtime`         | setup-time runtime helpers that stay available in `setupEntry` / deferred channel startup | `createPatchedAccountSetupAdapter`, `createEnvPatchedAccountSetupAdapter`, `createSetupInputPresenceValidator`, `noteChannelLookupFailure`, `noteChannelLookupSummary`, `promptResolvedAllowFrom`, `splitSetupEntries`, `createAllowlistSetupWizardProxy`, `createDelegatedSetupWizardProxy` |
| `plugin-sdk/setup-adapter-runtime` | environment-aware account setup adapters                                                  | `createEnvPatchedAccountSetupAdapter`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `plugin-sdk/setup-tools`           | setup/install CLI/archive/docs helpers                                                    | `formatCliCommand`, `detectBinary`, `extractArchive`, `resolveBrewExecutable`, `formatDocsLink`, `CONFIG_DIR`                                                                                                                                                                                |

Use the broader `plugin-sdk/setup` seam when you want the full shared setup
toolbox, including config-patch helpers such as
`moveSingleAccountChannelSectionToDefaultAccount(...)`.

The setup patch adapters stay hot-path safe on import. Their bundled
single-account promotion contract-surface lookup is lazy, so importing
`plugin-sdk/setup-runtime` does not eagerly load bundled contract-surface
discovery before the adapter is actually used.

### Channel-owned single-account promotion

When a channel upgrades from a single-account top-level config to
`channels.<id>.accounts.*`, the default shared behavior is to move promoted
account-scoped values into `accounts.default`.

Bundled channels can narrow or override that promotion through their setup
contract surface:

- `singleAccountKeysToMove`: extra top-level keys that should move into the
  promoted account
- `namedAccountPromotionKeys`: when named accounts already exist, only these
  keys move into the promoted account; shared policy/delivery keys stay at the
  channel root
- `resolveSingleAccountPromotionTarget(...)`: choose which existing account
  receives promoted values

Matrix is the current bundled example. If exactly one named Matrix account
already exists, or if `defaultAccount` points at an existing non-canonical key
such as `Ops`, promotion preserves that account instead of creating a new
`accounts.default` entry.

## Config schema

Plugin config is validated against the JSON Schema in your manifest. Users
configure plugins via:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "my-plugin": {
        config: {
          webhookSecret: "abc123",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Your plugin receives this config as `api.pluginConfig` during registration.

For channel-specific config, use the channel config section instead:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    "my-channel": {
      token: "bot-token",
      allowFrom: ["user1", "user2"],
    },
  },
}
```

### Building channel config schemas

Use `buildChannelConfigSchema` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` to convert a
Zod schema into the `ChannelConfigSchema` wrapper that OpenClaw validates:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { buildChannelConfigSchema } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/core";

const accountSchema = z.object({
  token: z.string().optional(),
  allowFrom: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  accounts: z.object({}).catchall(z.any()).optional(),
  defaultAccount: z.string().optional(),
});

const configSchema = buildChannelConfigSchema(accountSchema);
```

## Setup wizards

Channel plugins can provide interactive setup wizards for `openclaw onboard`.
The wizard is a `ChannelSetupWizard` object on the `ChannelPlugin`:

```typescript
import type { ChannelSetupWizard } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-setup";

const setupWizard: ChannelSetupWizard = {
  channel: "my-channel",
  status: {
    configuredLabel: "Connected",
    unconfiguredLabel: "Not configured",
    resolveConfigured: ({ cfg }) => Boolean((cfg.channels as any)?.["my-channel"]?.token),
  },
  credentials: [
    {
      inputKey: "token",
      providerHint: "my-channel",
      credentialLabel: "Bot token",
      preferredEnvVar: "MY_CHANNEL_BOT_TOKEN",
      envPrompt: "Use MY_CHANNEL_BOT_TOKEN from environment?",
      keepPrompt: "Keep current token?",
      inputPrompt: "Enter your bot token:",
      inspect: ({ cfg, accountId }) => {
        const token = (cfg.channels as any)?.["my-channel"]?.token;
        return {
          accountConfigured: Boolean(token),
          hasConfiguredValue: Boolean(token),
        };
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

The `ChannelSetupWizard` type supports `credentials`, `textInputs`,
`dmPolicy`, `allowFrom`, `groupAccess`, `prepare`, `finalize`, and more.
See bundled plugin packages (for example the Discord plugin `src/channel.setup.ts`) for
full examples.

For DM allowlist prompts that only need the standard
`note -> prompt -> parse -> merge -> patch` flow, prefer the shared setup
helpers from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/setup`: `createPromptParsedAllowFromForAccount(...)`,
`createTopLevelChannelParsedAllowFromPrompt(...)`, and
`createNestedChannelParsedAllowFromPrompt(...)`.

For channel setup status blocks that only vary by labels, scores, and optional
extra lines, prefer `createStandardChannelSetupStatus(...)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/setup` instead of hand-rolling the same `status` object in
each plugin.

For optional setup surfaces that should only appear in certain contexts, use
`createOptionalChannelSetupSurface` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-setup`:

```typescript
import { createOptionalChannelSetupSurface } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-setup";

const setupSurface = createOptionalChannelSetupSurface({
  channel: "my-channel",
  label: "My Channel",
  npmSpec: "@myorg/openclaw-my-channel",
  docsPath: "/channels/my-channel",
});
// Returns { setupAdapter, setupWizard }
```

`plugin-sdk/channel-setup` also exposes the lower-level
`createOptionalChannelSetupAdapter(...)` and
`createOptionalChannelSetupWizard(...)` builders when you only need one half of
that optional-install surface.

The generated optional adapter/wizard fail closed on real config writes. They
reuse one install-required message across `validateInput`,
`applyAccountConfig`, and `finalize`, and append a docs link when `docsPath` is
set.

For binary-backed setup UIs, prefer the shared delegated helpers instead of
copying the same binary/status glue into every channel:

- `createDetectedBinaryStatus(...)` for status blocks that vary only by labels,
  hints, scores, and binary detection
- `createCliPathTextInput(...)` for path-backed text inputs
- `createDelegatedSetupWizardStatusResolvers(...)`,
  `createDelegatedPrepare(...)`, `createDelegatedFinalize(...)`, and
  `createDelegatedResolveConfigured(...)` when `setupEntry` needs to forward to
  a heavier full wizard lazily
- `createDelegatedTextInputShouldPrompt(...)` when `setupEntry` only needs to
  delegate a `textInputs[*].shouldPrompt` decision

## Publishing and installing

**External plugins:** publish to [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) or npm, then install:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @myorg/openclaw-my-plugin
```

OpenClaw tries ClawHub first and falls back to npm automatically. You can also
force ClawHub explicitly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@myorg/openclaw-my-plugin   # ClawHub only
```

There is no matching `npm:` override. Use the normal npm package spec when you
want the npm path after ClawHub fallback:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @myorg/openclaw-my-plugin
```

**In-repo plugins:** place under the bundled plugin workspace tree and they are automatically
discovered during build.

**Users can install:**

```bash
openclaw plugins install <package-name>
```

<Info>
  For npm-sourced installs, `openclaw plugins install` runs
  `npm install --ignore-scripts` (no lifecycle scripts). Keep plugin dependency
  trees pure JS/TS and avoid packages that require `postinstall` builds.
