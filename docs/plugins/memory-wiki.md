# Memory Wiki

`memory-wiki` is a bundled plugin that turns durable memory into a compiled
knowledge vault.

It does **not** replace the active memory plugin. The active memory plugin still
owns recall, promotion, indexing, and dreaming. `memory-wiki` sits beside it
and compiles durable knowledge into a navigable wiki with deterministic pages,
structured claims, provenance, dashboards, and machine-readable digests.

Use it when you want memory to behave more like a maintained knowledge layer and
less like a pile of Markdown files.

## What it adds

- A dedicated wiki vault with deterministic page layout
- Structured claim and evidence metadata, not just prose
- Page-level provenance, confidence, contradictions, and open questions
- Compiled digests for agent/runtime consumers
- Wiki-native search/get/apply/lint tools
- Optional bridge mode that imports public artifacts from the active memory plugin
- Optional Obsidian-friendly render mode and CLI integration

## How it fits with memory

Think of the split like this:

| Layer                                                   | Owns                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Active memory plugin (`memory-core`, QMD, Honcho, etc.) | Recall, semantic search, promotion, dreaming, memory runtime                               |
| `memory-wiki`                                           | Compiled wiki pages, provenance-rich syntheses, dashboards, wiki-specific search/get/apply |

If the active memory plugin exposes shared recall artifacts, OpenClaw can search
both layers in one pass with `memory_search corpus=all`.

When you need wiki-specific ranking, provenance, or direct page access, use the
wiki-native tools instead.

## Vault modes

`memory-wiki` supports three vault modes:

### `isolated`

Own vault, own sources, no dependency on `memory-core`.

Use this when you want the wiki to be its own curated knowledge store.

### `bridge`

Reads public memory artifacts and memory events from the active memory plugin
through public plugin SDK seams.

Use this when you want the wiki to compile and organize the memory plugin's
exported artifacts without reaching into private plugin internals.

Bridge mode can index:

- exported memory artifacts
- dream reports
- daily notes
- memory root files
- memory event logs

### `unsafe-local`

Explicit same-machine escape hatch for local private paths.

This mode is intentionally experimental and non-portable. Use it only when you
understand the trust boundary and specifically need local filesystem access that
bridge mode cannot provide.

## Vault layout

The plugin initializes a vault like this:

```text
<vault>/
  AGENTS.md
  WIKI.md
  index.md
  inbox.md
  entities/
  concepts/
  syntheses/
  sources/
  reports/
  _attachments/
  _views/
  .openclaw-wiki/
```

Managed content stays inside generated blocks. Human note blocks are preserved.

The main page groups are:

- `sources/` for imported raw material and bridge-backed pages
- `entities/` for durable things, people, systems, projects, and objects
- `concepts/` for ideas, abstractions, patterns, and policies
- `syntheses/` for compiled summaries and maintained rollups
- `reports/` for generated dashboards

## Structured claims and evidence

Pages can carry structured `claims` frontmatter, not just freeform text.

Each claim can include:

- `id`
- `text`
- `status`
- `confidence`
- `evidence[]`
- `updatedAt`

Evidence entries can include:

- `sourceId`
- `path`
- `lines`
- `weight`
- `note`
- `updatedAt`

This is what makes the wiki act more like a belief layer than a passive note
dump. Claims can be tracked, scored, contested, and resolved back to sources.

## Compile pipeline

The compile step reads wiki pages, normalizes summaries, and emits stable
machine-facing artifacts under:

- `.openclaw-wiki/cache/agent-digest.json`
- `.openclaw-wiki/cache/claims.jsonl`

These digests exist so agents and runtime code do not have to scrape Markdown
pages.

Compiled output also powers:

- first-pass wiki indexing for search/get flows
- claim-id lookup back to owning pages
- compact prompt supplements
- report/dashboard generation

## Dashboards and health reports

When `render.createDashboards` is enabled, compile maintains dashboards under
`reports/`.

Built-in reports include:

- `reports/open-questions.md`
- `reports/contradictions.md`
- `reports/low-confidence.md`
- `reports/claim-health.md`
- `reports/stale-pages.md`

These reports track things like:

- contradiction note clusters
- competing claim clusters
- claims missing structured evidence
- low-confidence pages and claims
- stale or unknown freshness
- pages with unresolved questions

## Search and retrieval

`memory-wiki` supports two search backends:

- `shared`: use the shared memory search flow when available
- `local`: search the wiki locally

It also supports three corpora:

- `wiki`
- `memory`
- `all`

Important behavior:

- `wiki_search` and `wiki_get` use compiled digests as a first pass when possible
- claim ids can resolve back to the owning page
- contested/stale/fresh claims influence ranking
- provenance labels can survive into results

Practical rule:

- use `memory_search corpus=all` for one broad recall pass
- use `wiki_search` + `wiki_get` when you care about wiki-specific ranking,
  provenance, or page-level belief structure

## Agent tools

The plugin registers these tools:

- `wiki_status`
- `wiki_search`
- `wiki_get`
- `wiki_apply`
- `wiki_lint`

What they do:

- `wiki_status`: current vault mode, health, Obsidian CLI availability
- `wiki_search`: search wiki pages and, when configured, shared memory corpora
- `wiki_get`: read a wiki page by id/path or fall back to shared memory corpus
- `wiki_apply`: narrow synthesis/metadata mutations without freeform page surgery
- `wiki_lint`: structural checks, provenance gaps, contradictions, open questions

The plugin also registers a non-exclusive memory corpus supplement, so shared
`memory_search` and `memory_get` can reach the wiki when the active memory
plugin supports corpus selection.

## Prompt and context behavior

When `context.includeCompiledDigestPrompt` is enabled, memory prompt sections
append a compact compiled snapshot from `agent-digest.json`.

That snapshot is intentionally small and high-signal:

- top pages only
- top claims only
- contradiction count
- question count
- confidence/freshness qualifiers

This is opt-in because it changes prompt shape and is mainly useful for context
engines or legacy prompt assembly that explicitly consume memory supplements.

## Configuration

Put config under `plugins.entries.memory-wiki.config`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "memory-wiki": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          vaultMode: "isolated",
          vault: {
            path: "~/.openclaw/wiki/main",
            renderMode: "obsidian",
          },
          obsidian: {
            enabled: true,
            useOfficialCli: true,
            vaultName: "OpenClaw Wiki",
            openAfterWrites: false,
          },
          bridge: {
            enabled: false,
            readMemoryArtifacts: true,
            indexDreamReports: true,
            indexDailyNotes: true,
            indexMemoryRoot: true,
            followMemoryEvents: true,
          },
          ingest: {
            autoCompile: true,
            maxConcurrentJobs: 1,
            allowUrlIngest: true,
          },
          search: {
            backend: "shared",
            corpus: "wiki",
          },
          context: {
            includeCompiledDigestPrompt: false,
          },
          render: {
            preserveHumanBlocks: true,
            createBacklinks: true,
            createDashboards: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Key toggles:

- `vaultMode`: `isolated`, `bridge`, `unsafe-local`
- `vault.renderMode`: `native` or `obsidian`
- `bridge.readMemoryArtifacts`: import active memory plugin public artifacts
- `bridge.followMemoryEvents`: include event logs in bridge mode
- `search.backend`: `shared` or `local`
- `search.corpus`: `wiki`, `memory`, or `all`
- `context.includeCompiledDigestPrompt`: append compact digest snapshot to memory prompt sections
- `render.createBacklinks`: generate deterministic related blocks
- `render.createDashboards`: generate dashboard pages

## CLI

`memory-wiki` also exposes a top-level CLI surface:

```bash
openclaw wiki status
openclaw wiki doctor
openclaw wiki init
openclaw wiki ingest ./notes/alpha.md
openclaw wiki compile
openclaw wiki lint
openclaw wiki search "alpha"
openclaw wiki get entity.alpha
openclaw wiki apply synthesis "Alpha Summary" --body "..." --source-id source.alpha
openclaw wiki bridge import
openclaw wiki obsidian status
```

See [CLI: wiki](/cli/wiki) for the full command reference.

## Obsidian support

When `vault.renderMode` is `obsidian`, the plugin writes Obsidian-friendly
Markdown and can optionally use the official `obsidian` CLI.

Supported workflows include:

- status probing
- vault search
- opening a page
- invoking an Obsidian command
- jumping to the daily note

This is optional. The wiki still works in native mode without Obsidian.

## Recommended workflow

1. Keep your active memory plugin for recall/promotion/dreaming.
2. Enable `memory-wiki`.
3. Start with `isolated` mode unless you explicitly want bridge mode.
4. Use `wiki_search` / `wiki_get` when provenance matters.
5. Use `wiki_apply` for narrow syntheses or metadata updates.
6. Run `wiki_lint` after meaningful changes.
7. Turn on dashboards if you want stale/contradiction visibility.
