# Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts for local workflows and ops tasks.
Use these when a task is clearly tied to a script; otherwise prefer the CLI.

## Conventions

- Scripts are **optional** unless referenced in docs or release checklists.
- Prefer CLI surfaces when they exist (example: auth monitoring uses `openclaw models status --check`).
- Assume scripts are host‑specific; read them before running on a new machine.

## Auth monitoring scripts

Auth monitoring is covered in [Authentication](/gateway/authentication). The scripts under `scripts/` are optional extras for systemd/Termux phone workflows.

## GitHub read helper

Use `scripts/gh-read` when you want `gh` to use a GitHub App installation token for repo-scoped read calls while leaving normal `gh` on your personal login for write actions.

Required env:

- `OPENCLAW_GH_READ_APP_ID`
- `OPENCLAW_GH_READ_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`

Optional env:

- `OPENCLAW_GH_READ_INSTALLATION_ID` when you want to skip repo-based installation lookup
- `OPENCLAW_GH_READ_PERMISSIONS` as a comma-separated override for the read permission subset to request

Repo resolution order:

- `gh ... -R owner/repo`
- `GH_REPO`
- `git remote origin`

Examples:

- `scripts/gh-read pr view 123`
- `scripts/gh-read run list -R openclaw/openclaw`
- `scripts/gh-read api repos/openclaw/openclaw/pulls/123`

## When adding scripts

- Keep scripts focused and documented.
- Add a short entry in the relevant doc (or create one if missing).
