# Compaction

Every model has a context window -- the maximum number of tokens it can process.
When a conversation approaches that limit, OpenClaw **compacts** older messages
into a summary so the chat can continue.

## How it works

1. Older conversation turns are summarized into a compact entry.
2. The summary is saved in the session transcript.
3. Recent messages are kept intact.

When OpenClaw splits history into compaction chunks, it keeps assistant tool
calls paired with their matching `toolResult` entries. If a split point lands
inside a tool block, OpenClaw moves the boundary so the pair stays together and
the current unsummarized tail is preserved.

The full conversation history stays on disk. Compaction only changes what the
model sees on the next turn.

## Auto-compaction

Auto-compaction is on by default. It runs when the session nears the context
limit, or when the model returns a context-overflow error (in which case
OpenClaw compacts and retries). Typical overflow signatures include
`request_too_large`, `context length exceeded`, `input exceeds the maximum
number of tokens`, `input token count exceeds the maximum number of input
tokens`, `input is too long for the model`, and `ollama error: context length
exceeded`.

<Info>
Before compacting, OpenClaw automatically reminds the agent to save important
notes to [memory](/concepts/memory) files. This prevents context loss.

## Manual compaction

Type `/compact` in any chat to force a compaction. Add instructions to guide
the summary:

```
/compact Focus on the API design decisions
```

## Using a different model

By default, compaction uses your agent's primary model. You can use a more
capable model for better summaries:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      compaction: {
        model: "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Compaction start notice

By default, compaction runs silently. To show a brief notice when compaction
starts, enable `notifyUser`:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      compaction: {
        notifyUser: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

When enabled, the user sees a short message (for example, "Compacting
context...") at the start of each compaction run.

## Compaction vs pruning

|                  | Compaction                    | Pruning                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **What it does** | Summarizes older conversation | Trims old tool results           |
| **Saved?**       | Yes (in session transcript)   | No (in-memory only, per request) |
| **Scope**        | Entire conversation           | Tool results only                |

[Session pruning](/concepts/session-pruning) is a lighter-weight complement that
trims tool output without summarizing.

## Troubleshooting

**Compacting too often?** The model's context window may be small, or tool
outputs may be large. Try enabling
[session pruning](/concepts/session-pruning).

**Context feels stale after compaction?** Use `/compact Focus on <topic>` to
guide the summary, or enable the [memory flush](/concepts/memory) so notes
survive.

**Need a clean slate?** `/new` starts a fresh session without compacting.

context engines, OpenAI server-side compaction), see the
