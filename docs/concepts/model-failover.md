# Model failover

OpenClaw handles failures in two stages:

1. **Auth profile rotation** within the current provider.
2. **Model fallback** to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.

This doc explains the runtime rules and the data that backs them.

## Runtime flow

For a normal text run, OpenClaw evaluates candidates in this order:

1. The currently selected session model.
2. Configured `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` in order.
3. The configured primary model at the end when the run started from an override.

Inside each candidate, OpenClaw tries auth-profile failover before advancing to
the next model candidate.

High-level sequence:

1. Resolve the active session model and auth-profile preference.
2. Build the model candidate chain.
3. Try the current provider with auth-profile rotation/cooldown rules.
4. If that provider is exhausted with a failover-worthy error, move to the next
   model candidate.
5. Persist the selected fallback override before the retry starts so other
   session readers see the same provider/model the runner is about to use.
6. If the fallback candidate fails, roll back only the fallback-owned session
   override fields when they still match that failed candidate.
7. If every candidate fails, throw a `FallbackSummaryError` with per-attempt
   detail and the soonest cooldown expiry when one is known.

This is intentionally narrower than "save and restore the whole session". The
reply runner only persists the model-selection fields it owns for fallback:

- `providerOverride`
- `modelOverride`
- `authProfileOverride`
- `authProfileOverrideSource`
- `authProfileOverrideCompactionCount`

That prevents a failed fallback retry from overwriting newer unrelated session
mutations such as manual `/model` changes or session rotation updates that
happened while the attempt was running.

## Auth storage (keys + OAuth)

OpenClaw uses **auth profiles** for both API keys and OAuth tokens.

- Secrets live in `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` (legacy: `~/.openclaw/agent/auth-profiles.json`).
- Config `auth.profiles` / `auth.order` are **metadata + routing only** (no secrets).
- Legacy import-only OAuth file: `~/.openclaw/credentials/oauth.json` (imported into `auth-profiles.json` on first use).

More detail: [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth)

Credential types:

- `type: "api_key"` → `{ provider, key }`
- `type: "oauth"` → `{ provider, access, refresh, expires, email? }` (+ `projectId`/`enterpriseUrl` for some providers)

## Profile IDs

OAuth logins create distinct profiles so multiple accounts can coexist.

- Default: `provider:default` when no email is available.
- OAuth with email: `provider:<email>` (for example `google-antigravity:user@gmail.com`).

Profiles live in `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` under `profiles`.

## Rotation order

When a provider has multiple profiles, OpenClaw chooses an order like this:

1. **Explicit config**: `auth.order[provider]` (if set).
2. **Configured profiles**: `auth.profiles` filtered by provider.
3. **Stored profiles**: entries in `auth-profiles.json` for the provider.

If no explicit order is configured, OpenClaw uses a round‑robin order:

- **Primary key:** profile type (**OAuth before API keys**).
- **Secondary key:** `usageStats.lastUsed` (oldest first, within each type).
- **Cooldown/disabled profiles** are moved to the end, ordered by soonest expiry.

### Session stickiness (cache-friendly)

OpenClaw **pins the chosen auth profile per session** to keep provider caches warm.
It does **not** rotate on every request. The pinned profile is reused until:

- the session is reset (`/new` / `/reset`)
- a compaction completes (compaction count increments)
- the profile is in cooldown/disabled

Manual selection via `/model …@<profileId>` sets a **user override** for that session
and is not auto‑rotated until a new session starts.

Auto‑pinned profiles (selected by the session router) are treated as a **preference**:
they are tried first, but OpenClaw may rotate to another profile on rate limits/timeouts.
User‑pinned profiles stay locked to that profile; if it fails and model fallbacks
are configured, OpenClaw moves to the next model instead of switching profiles.

### Why OAuth can "look lost"

If you have both an OAuth profile and an API key profile for the same provider, round‑robin can switch between them across messages unless pinned. To force a single profile:

- Pin with `auth.order[provider] = ["provider:profileId"]`, or
- Use a per-session override via `/model …` with a profile override (when supported by your UI/chat surface).

## Cooldowns

When a profile fails due to auth/rate‑limit errors (or a timeout that looks
like rate limiting), OpenClaw marks it in cooldown and moves to the next profile.
That rate-limit bucket is broader than plain `429`: it also includes provider
messages such as `Too many concurrent requests`, `ThrottlingException`,
`concurrency limit reached`, `workers_ai ... quota limit exceeded`,
`throttled`, `resource exhausted`, and periodic usage-window limits such as
`weekly/monthly limit reached`.
Format/invalid‑request errors (for example Cloud Code Assist tool call ID
validation failures) are treated as failover‑worthy and use the same cooldowns.
OpenAI-compatible stop-reason errors such as `Unhandled stop reason: error`,
`stop reason: error`, and `reason: error` are classified as timeout/failover
signals.
Provider-scoped generic server text can also land in that timeout bucket when
the source matches a known transient pattern. For example, Anthropic bare
`An unknown error occurred` and JSON `api_error` payloads with transient server
text such as `internal server error`, `unknown error, 520`, `upstream error`,
or `backend error` are treated as failover-worthy timeouts. OpenRouter-specific
generic upstream text such as bare `Provider returned error` is also treated as
timeout only when the provider context is actually OpenRouter. Generic internal
fallback text such as `LLM request failed with an unknown error.` stays
conservative and does not trigger failover by itself.

Rate-limit cooldowns can also be model-scoped:

- OpenClaw records `cooldownModel` for rate-limit failures when the failing
  model id is known.
- A sibling model on the same provider can still be tried when the cooldown is
  scoped to a different model.
- Billing/disabled windows still block the whole profile across models.

Cooldowns use exponential backoff:

- 1 minute
- 5 minutes
- 25 minutes
- 1 hour (cap)

State is stored in `auth-profiles.json` under `usageStats`:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "lastUsed": 1736160000000,
      "cooldownUntil": 1736160600000,
      "errorCount": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Billing disables

Billing/credit failures (for example “insufficient credits” / “credit balance too low”) are treated as failover‑worthy, but they’re usually not transient. Instead of a short cooldown, OpenClaw marks the profile as **disabled** (with a longer backoff) and rotates to the next profile/provider.

Not every billing-shaped response is `402`, and not every HTTP `402` lands
here. OpenClaw keeps explicit billing text in the billing lane even when a
provider returns `401` or `403` instead, but provider-specific matchers stay
scoped to the provider that owns them (for example OpenRouter `403 Key limit
exceeded`). Meanwhile temporary `402` usage-window and
organization/workspace spend-limit errors are classified as `rate_limit` when
the message looks retryable (for example `weekly usage limit exhausted`, `daily
limit reached, resets tomorrow`, or `organization spending limit exceeded`).
Those stay on the short cooldown/failover path instead of the long
billing-disable path.

State is stored in `auth-profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "disabledUntil": 1736178000000,
      "disabledReason": "billing"
    }
  }
}
```

Defaults:

- Billing backoff starts at **5 hours**, doubles per billing failure, and caps at **24 hours**.
- Backoff counters reset if the profile hasn’t failed for **24 hours** (configurable).
- Overloaded retries allow **1 same-provider profile rotation** before model fallback.
- Overloaded retries use **0 ms backoff** by default.

## Model fallback

If all profiles for a provider fail, OpenClaw moves to the next model in
`agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`. This applies to auth failures, rate limits, and
timeouts that exhausted profile rotation (other errors do not advance fallback).

Overloaded and rate-limit errors are handled more aggressively than billing
cooldowns. By default, OpenClaw allows one same-provider auth-profile retry,
then switches to the next configured model fallback without waiting.
Provider-busy signals such as `ModelNotReadyException` land in that overloaded
bucket. Tune this with `auth.cooldowns.overloadedProfileRotations`,
`auth.cooldowns.overloadedBackoffMs`, and
`auth.cooldowns.rateLimitedProfileRotations`.

When a run starts with a model override (hooks or CLI), fallbacks still end at
`agents.defaults.model.primary` after trying any configured fallbacks.

### Candidate chain rules

OpenClaw builds the candidate list from the currently requested `provider/model`
plus configured fallbacks.

Rules:

- The requested model is always first.
- Explicit configured fallbacks are deduplicated but not filtered by the model
  allowlist. They are treated as explicit operator intent.
- If the current run is already on a configured fallback in the same provider
  family, OpenClaw keeps using the full configured chain.
- If the current run is on a different provider than config and that current
  model is not already part of the configured fallback chain, OpenClaw does not
  append unrelated configured fallbacks from another provider.
- When the run started from an override, the configured primary is appended at
  the end so the chain can settle back onto the normal default once earlier
  candidates are exhausted.

### Which errors advance fallback

Model fallback continues on:

- auth failures
- rate limits and cooldown exhaustion
- overloaded/provider-busy errors
- timeout-shaped failover errors
- billing disables
- `LiveSessionModelSwitchError`, which is normalized into a failover path so a
  stale persisted model does not create an outer retry loop
- other unrecognized errors when there are still remaining candidates

Model fallback does not continue on:

- explicit aborts that are not timeout/failover-shaped
- context overflow errors that should stay inside compaction/retry logic
  (for example `request_too_large`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT: input exceeds the maximum
number of tokens`, `input token count exceeds the maximum number of input
tokens`, `The input is too long for the model`, or `ollama error: context
length exceeded`)
- a final unknown error when there are no candidates left

### Cooldown skip vs probe behavior

When every auth profile for a provider is already in cooldown, OpenClaw does
not automatically skip that provider forever. It makes a per-candidate decision:

- Persistent auth failures skip the whole provider immediately.
- Billing disables usually skip, but the primary candidate can still be probed
  on a throttle so recovery is possible without restarting.
- The primary candidate may be probed near cooldown expiry, with a per-provider
  throttle.
- Same-provider fallback siblings can be attempted despite cooldown when the
  failure looks transient (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, or unknown). This is
  especially relevant when a rate limit is model-scoped and a sibling model may
  still recover immediately.
- Transient cooldown probes are limited to one per provider per fallback run so
  a single provider does not stall cross-provider fallback.

## Session overrides and live model switching

Session model changes are shared state. The active runner, `/model` command,
compaction/session updates, and live-session reconciliation all read or write
parts of the same session entry.

That means fallback retries have to coordinate with live model switching:

- Only explicit user-driven model changes mark a pending live switch. That
  includes `/model`, `session_status(model=...)`, and `sessions.patch`.
- System-driven model changes such as fallback rotation, heartbeat overrides,
  or compaction never mark a pending live switch on their own.
- Before a fallback retry starts, the reply runner persists the selected
  fallback override fields to the session entry.
- Live-session reconciliation prefers persisted session overrides over stale
  runtime model fields.
- If the fallback attempt fails, the runner rolls back only the override fields
  it wrote, and only if they still match that failed candidate.

This prevents the classic race:

1. Primary fails.
2. Fallback candidate is chosen in memory.
3. Session store still says the old primary.
4. Live-session reconciliation reads the stale session state.
5. The retry gets snapped back to the old model before the fallback attempt
   starts.

The persisted fallback override closes that window, and the narrow rollback
keeps newer manual or runtime session changes intact.

## Observability and failure summaries

`runWithModelFallback(...)` records per-attempt details that feed logs and
user-facing cooldown messaging:

- provider/model attempted
- reason (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `billing`, `auth`, `model_not_found`, and
  similar failover reasons)
- optional status/code
- human-readable error summary

When every candidate fails, OpenClaw throws `FallbackSummaryError`. The outer
reply runner can use that to build a more specific message such as "all models
are temporarily rate-limited" and include the soonest cooldown expiry when one
is known.

That cooldown summary is model-aware:

- unrelated model-scoped rate limits are ignored for the attempted
  provider/model chain
- if the remaining block is a matching model-scoped rate limit, OpenClaw
  reports the last matching expiry that still blocks that model
