# Network hub

This hub links the core docs for how OpenClaw connects, pairs, and secures
devices across localhost, LAN, and tailnet.

## Core model

Most operations flow through the Gateway (`openclaw gateway`), a single long-running process that owns channel connections and the WebSocket control plane.

- **Loopback first**: the Gateway WS defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.
  Non-loopback binds require a valid gateway auth path: shared-secret
  token/password auth, or a correctly configured non-loopback
  `trusted-proxy` deployment.
- **One Gateway per host** is recommended. For isolation, run multiple gateways with isolated profiles and ports ([Multiple Gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways)).
- **Canvas host** is served on the same port as the Gateway (`/__openclaw__/canvas/`, `/__openclaw__/a2ui/`), protected by Gateway auth when bound beyond loopback.
- **Remote access** is typically SSH tunnel or Tailscale VPN ([Remote Access](/gateway/remote)).

## Pairing + identity

- [Gateway-owned node pairing](/gateway/pairing)
- [Devices CLI (pairing + token rotation)](/cli/devices)
- [Pairing CLI (DM approvals)](/cli/pairing)

Local trust:

- Direct local loopback connects can be auto-approved for pairing to keep
  same-host UX smooth.
- OpenClaw also has a narrow backend/container-local self-connect path for
  trusted shared-secret helper flows.
- Tailnet and LAN clients, including same-host tailnet binds, still require
  explicit pairing approval.
