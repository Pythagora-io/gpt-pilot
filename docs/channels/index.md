# Chat Channels

OpenClaw can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

## Supported channels

- [BlueBubbles](/channels/bluebubbles) — **Recommended for iMessage**; uses the BlueBubbles macOS server REST API with full feature support (bundled plugin; edit, unsend, effects, reactions, group management — edit currently broken on macOS 26 Tahoe).
- [Discord](/channels/discord) — Discord Bot API + Gateway; supports servers, channels, and DMs.
- [Feishu](/channels/feishu) — Feishu/Lark bot via WebSocket (bundled plugin).
- [Google Chat](/channels/googlechat) — Google Chat API app via HTTP webhook.
- [iMessage (legacy)](/channels/imessage) — Legacy macOS integration via imsg CLI (deprecated, use BlueBubbles for new setups).
- [IRC](/channels/irc) — Classic IRC servers; channels + DMs with pairing/allowlist controls.
- [LINE](/channels/line) — LINE Messaging API bot (bundled plugin).
- [Matrix](/channels/matrix) — Matrix protocol (bundled plugin).
- [Mattermost](/channels/mattermost) — Bot API + WebSocket; channels, groups, DMs (bundled plugin).
- [Microsoft Teams](/channels/msteams) — Bot Framework; enterprise support (bundled plugin).
- [Nextcloud Talk](/channels/nextcloud-talk) — Self-hosted chat via Nextcloud Talk (bundled plugin).

- [Telegram](/channels/telegram) — Bot API via grammY; supports groups.
- [Tlon](/channels/tlon) — Urbit-based messenger (bundled plugin).
- [Twitch](/channels/twitch) — Twitch chat via IRC connection (bundled plugin).
- [Voice Call](/plugins/voice-call) — Telephony via Plivo or Twilio (plugin, installed separately).
- [WebChat](/web/webchat) — Gateway WebChat UI over WebSocket.
- [WeChat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin) — Tencent iLink Bot plugin via QR login; private chats only.
- [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp) — Most popular; uses Baileys and requires QR pairing.
- [Zalo](/channels/zalo) — Zalo Bot API; Vietnam's popular messenger (bundled plugin).
- [Zalo Personal](/channels/zalouser) — Zalo personal account via QR login (bundled plugin).

## Notes

- Channels can run simultaneously; configure multiple and OpenClaw will route per chat.
- Fastest setup is usually **Telegram** (simple bot token). WhatsApp requires QR pairing and
  stores more state on disk.
- Group behavior varies by channel; see [Groups](/channels/groups).
- DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](/gateway/security).
- Troubleshooting: [Channel troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).
- Model providers are documented separately; see [Model Providers](/providers/models).
