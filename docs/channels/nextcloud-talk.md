# Nextcloud Talk

Status: bundled plugin (webhook bot). Direct messages, rooms, reactions, and markdown messages are supported.

## Bundled plugin

Nextcloud Talk ships as a bundled plugin in current OpenClaw releases, so
normal packaged builds do not need a separate install.

If you are on an older build or a custom install that excludes Nextcloud Talk,
install it manually:

Install via CLI (npm registry):

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/nextcloud-talk
```

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./path/to/local/nextcloud-talk-plugin
```

Details: [Plugins](/tools/plugin)

## Quick setup (beginner)

1. Ensure the Nextcloud Talk plugin is available.
   - Current packaged OpenClaw releases already bundle it.
   - Older/custom installs can add it manually with the commands above.
2. On your Nextcloud server, create a bot:

   ```bash
   ./occ talk:bot:install "OpenClaw" "<shared-secret>" "<webhook-url>" --feature reaction
   ```

3. Enable the bot in the target room settings.
4. Configure OpenClaw:
   - Config: `channels.nextcloud-talk.baseUrl` + `channels.nextcloud-talk.botSecret`
   - Or env: `NEXTCLOUD_TALK_BOT_SECRET` (default account only)
5. Restart the gateway (or finish setup).

Minimal config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    "nextcloud-talk": {
      enabled: true,
      baseUrl: "https://cloud.example.com",
      botSecret: "shared-secret",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
    },
  },
}
```

## Notes

- Bots cannot initiate DMs. The user must message the bot first.
- Webhook URL must be reachable by the Gateway; set `webhookPublicUrl` if behind a proxy.
- Media uploads are not supported by the bot API; media is sent as URLs.
- The webhook payload does not distinguish DMs vs rooms; set `apiUser` + `apiPassword` to enable room-type lookups (otherwise DMs are treated as rooms).

## Access control (DMs)

- Default: `channels.nextcloud-talk.dmPolicy = "pairing"`. Unknown senders get a pairing code.
- Approve via:
  - `openclaw pairing list nextcloud-talk`
  - `openclaw pairing approve nextcloud-talk <CODE>`
- Public DMs: `channels.nextcloud-talk.dmPolicy="open"` plus `channels.nextcloud-talk.allowFrom=["*"]`.
- `allowFrom` matches Nextcloud user IDs only; display names are ignored.

## Rooms (groups)

- Default: `channels.nextcloud-talk.groupPolicy = "allowlist"` (mention-gated).
- Allowlist rooms with `channels.nextcloud-talk.rooms`:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    "nextcloud-talk": {
      rooms: {
        "room-token": { requireMention: true },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- To allow no rooms, keep the allowlist empty or set `channels.nextcloud-talk.groupPolicy="disabled"`.
