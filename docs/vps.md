# Linux Server

Run the OpenClaw Gateway on any Linux server or cloud VPS. This page helps you
pick a provider, explains how cloud deployments work, and covers generic Linux
tuning that applies everywhere.

## Pick a provider

**AWS (EC2 / Lightsail / free tier)** also works well.

## How cloud setups work

- The **Gateway runs on the VPS** and owns state + workspace.
- You connect from your laptop or phone via the **Control UI** or **Tailscale/SSH**.
- Treat the VPS as the source of truth and **back up** the state + workspace regularly.
- Secure default: keep the Gateway on loopback and access it via SSH tunnel or Tailscale Serve.
  If you bind to `lan` or `tailnet`, require `gateway.auth.token` or `gateway.auth.password`.

## Shared company agent on a VPS

Running a single agent for a team is a valid setup when every user is in the same trust boundary and the agent is business-only.

- Keep it on a dedicated runtime (VPS/VM/container + dedicated OS user/accounts).
- Do not sign that runtime into personal Apple/Google accounts or personal browser/password-manager profiles.
- If users are adversarial to each other, split by gateway/host/OS user.

Security model details: [Security](/gateway/security).

## Using nodes with a VPS

You can keep the Gateway in the cloud and pair **nodes** on your local devices
(Mac/iOS/Android/headless). Nodes provide local screen/camera/canvas and `system.run`
capabilities while the Gateway stays in the cloud.

Docs: [Nodes](/nodes), [Nodes CLI](/cli/nodes).

## Startup tuning for small VMs and ARM hosts

If CLI commands feel slow on low-power VMs (or ARM hosts), enable Node's module compile cache:

```bash
grep -q 'NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache' ~/.bashrc || cat >> ~/.bashrc <<'EOF'
export NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
mkdir -p /var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
export OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
```

- `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE` improves repeated command startup times.
- `OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1` avoids extra startup overhead from a self-respawn path.
- First command run warms the cache; subsequent runs are faster.
- For Raspberry Pi specifics, see [Raspberry Pi](/install/raspberry-pi).

### systemd tuning checklist (optional)

For VM hosts using `systemd`, consider:

- Add service env for a stable startup path:
  - `OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1`
  - `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache`
- Keep restart behavior explicit:
  - `Restart=always`
  - `RestartSec=2`
  - `TimeoutStartSec=90`
- Prefer SSD-backed disks for state/cache paths to reduce random-I/O cold-start penalties.

Example:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit openclaw
```

```ini
[Service]
Environment=OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1
Environment=NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
TimeoutStartSec=90
```
