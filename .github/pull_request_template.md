## Summary

Describe the problem and fix in 2–5 bullets:

If this PR fixes a plugin beta-release blocker, title it `fix(<plugin-id>): beta blocker - <summary>` and link the matching `Beta blocker: <plugin-name> - <summary>` issue labeled `beta-blocker`. Contributors cannot label PRs, so the title is the PR-side signal for maintainers and automation.

## Linked Issue/PR

- [ ] This PR fixes a bug or regression

## Root Cause (if applicable)

For bug fixes or regressions, explain why this happened, not just what changed. Otherwise write `N/A`. If the cause is unclear, write `Unknown`.

- Root cause:
- Missing detection / guardrail:
- Contributing context (if known):

## Regression Test Plan (if applicable)

For bug fixes or regressions, name the smallest reliable test coverage that should catch this. Otherwise write `N/A`.

- Coverage level that should have caught this:
  - [ ] Unit test
  - [ ] Seam / integration test
  - [ ] End-to-end test
  - [ ] Existing coverage already sufficient
- Target test or file:
- Scenario the test should lock in:
- Why this is the smallest reliable guardrail:
- Existing test that already covers this (if any):
- If no new test is added, why not:

## User-visible / Behavior Changes

List user-visible changes (including defaults/config).  
If none, write `None`.

## Diagram (if applicable)

For UI changes or non-trivial logic flows, include a small ASCII diagram reviewers can scan quickly. Otherwise write `N/A`.

Before:
[user action] -> [old state]

After:
[user action] -> [new state] -> [result]
