I have a project with the following folders and files:
```
{{ project_structure }}
```

I want you to read the file `{{ file_path }}` that has the following content:
```
{{ file_content }}
```

If you had to guess what does this file do without having a context of the entire app of which it's a part of, what would you say that this file is meant for?
