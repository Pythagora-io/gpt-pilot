{% if completed_steps -%}
Here is a list of completed steps:
```{% for step in completed_steps %}
step #{{ loop.index - 1 }}:
step_type: {{ step.type }}{% if 'command' in step %}
command_to_run: `{{ step.command.command }}`{% elif step.type == 'code_change' %}
code_change_description: `{{ step.code_change_description }}`{% endif %}{% endfor %}
```
{% endif %}

Right now, we're working on the step #{{ current_step_index }}:
```
step_type: {{ current_step.type }}
command_to_run: `{{ current_step.command.command }}`
```

We've run the command `{{ current_step.command.command }}` and we got the following output:
{{ cli_response }}

{% if next_steps %}
Here is a list of steps that will be executed after current step:
```{% for step in next_steps %}
step #{{ loop.index + current_step_index }}:
step_type: {{ step.type }}{% if 'command' in step %}
command_to_run: `{{ step.command.command }}`{% elif step.type == 'code_change' %}
code_change_description: `{{ step.code_change_description }}`{% endif %}{% endfor %}
```

Now, think step by step and create a new list of task steps to complete this task based on the output we got from running `{{ current_step.command.command }}`. It will either be the same as it is now or any of the Next Task Steps may or may not be needed anymore.
{% endif %}

{#
{% if len(next_steps) > 0 -%}
Now, think step by step and tell me if the next command `{{ next_steps[0] }}` should be executed or not. If it should be executed, respond with `RUN`. If it shouldn't be executed, respond with `SKIP`.
{% else -%}
When you look at the output of the command run, is there anything else that should be done to complete this task. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `NEEDS_DEBUGGING`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.
