Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `{{ instructions_prefix }}` and ends with `{{ instructions_postfix }}` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

{{ file_naming }}

{{ execution_order }}

{{ logs_and_error_handling }}

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.
