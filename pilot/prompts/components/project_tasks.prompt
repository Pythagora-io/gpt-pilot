Before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this {{ task_type }} into smaller tasks so that it is easier to develop, debug and make the {{ task_type }} work. Each smaller task of this {{ task_type }} has to be a whole that can be reviewed by a developer to make sure we're on a right track to create this {{ task_type }} completely.

Each task needs to be related only to the development of this {{ task_type }} and nothing else - once the {{ task_type }} is fully working, that is it. There shouldn't be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, or anything that is not writing the actual code.

Now, based on the project details provided{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} and new feature description{% endif %}, think task by task and create the entire development plan{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} for new feature{% endif %}.{% if task_type  == 'app' %} Start from the project setup and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working.{% endif %}

**IMPORTANT**
Dividing project into tasks is extremely important job and has to be done carefully while always strictly following all rules listed bellow.

Rule #1
There should never be a task that is only testing or ensuring something works, every task must have coding involved. Have this in mind for every task, but it is extremely important for last task of project. Testing if {{ task_type }} works will be done as part of each task.

Rule #2
This rule applies to the complexity of tasks.
You have to make sure the project is not split into tasks that are too small or simple for no reason but also not too big or complex so that they are hard to develop, debug and review.
Have in mind that project already has workspace folder created and only system dependencies installed. You don't have to create tasks for that.
Here are examples of poorly created tasks:

**too simple tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project and install all necessary dependencies.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection using Mongoose with the IP '127.0.0.1'.

**too complex tasks**
- Set up Node.js project with /home, /profile, /register and /login routes that will have user authentication, connection to MongoDB with user schemas, mailing of new users and frontend with nice design.

You must to avoid creating tasks that are too simple or too complex. You have to aim to create tasks that are medium complexity. Here are examples of tasks that are good:

**good tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project, install all necessary dependencies and set up an express server with a simple route to `/ping` that returns the status 200.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection and implement the message schema using Mongoose for persistent storage of messages.

Rule #3
This rule applies to the number of tasks you will create.
Every {{ task_type }} should have different number of tasks depending on complexity. Think task by task and create the minimum number of tasks that are relevant for this specific {{ task_type }}.{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} If the feature is small, it is ok to have only 1 task.{% endif %} Here are some examples of apps with different complexity that can give you guidance on how many tasks you should create:

Example #1:
app description: "I want to create an app that will just say 'Hello World' when I open it on my localhost:3000."
number of tasks: 1-2

Example #2:
app description: "Create a node.js app that enables users to register and log into the app. On frontend it should have /home (shows user data), /register and /login. It should use sessions to keep user logged in."
number of tasks: 2-4

Example #3:
app description: "A cool online shoe store, with a sleek look. In terms of data models, there are shoes, categories and user profiles. For web pages: product listing, details, shopping cart. It must look cool and jazzy."
number of tasks: 5-15

Rule #4
This rule applies to writing task 'description'.
Every task must have a clear and very detailed (must be minimum of 4 sentences but can be more) 'description'. It must be very clear so that even developers who just moved to this project can execute them without additional questions. It is not enough to just write something like "Create a route for /home". You have to describe what needs to be done in that route, what data needs to be returned, what should be the status code, etc. Give as many details as possible and make sure no information is missing that could be needed for this task.
Here is an example of good and bad task description:

**bad task**
{
    "description": "Create a route for /dashboard",
    "user_review_goal": "Reviewer should confirming the /dashboard endpoint is working correct."
}

**good task**
{
    "description": "In 'route.js' add a route for /dashboard that returns the status 200. Route should be accessible only for logged in users. In 'middlewares.js' there should be a check if user is logged in using session. If user is not logged in, it should redirect to /login. If user is logged in, it should return the user data. User data should be fetched from database in 'users' collection using the user id from session.",
    "user_review_goal": "Reviewer should be able to navigate to '/dashboard' page without error. If user is logged in it should show user data, if not it should redirect to /login."
}


Rule #5
When you're thinking about what tasks should be first, always prioritize frontend tasks to be implemented before backend tasks so that, once we get to the backend implementation, the user can test the backend by clicking around the frontend and not use tools like cUrl or Postman to make API requests to test the backend.
