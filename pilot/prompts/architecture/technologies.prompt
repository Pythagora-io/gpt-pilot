You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a {{app_type}} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create specifications on what technologies should be used in this project.

Here is a high level description of "{{ name }}":
```
{{ prompt }}
```

{% if clarifications %}
Here are some additional questions and answers to clarify the apps description:
```
{% for clarification in clarifications %}
Q: {{ clarification.question }}
A: {{ clarification.answer }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% endif %}
{% if user_stories %}
Here are user stories that specify how users use "{{ name }}":
```
{% for story in user_stories %}
- {{ story }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% endif %}
{% if user_tasks %}
Here are user tasks that specify what users need to do to interact with "{{ name }}":
```
{% for task in user_tasks %}
- {{ task }}
{% endfor %}
```

{% endif %}
Now, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies that will be used by your development team to create the app "{{ name }}".
Do not give any subjective thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:
Instead of ["D3.js or other suitable charting library", "axios or other http client library"] answer with ["D3.js", "axios"].

You do not need to list any technologies related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any technologies related to deployment (like Heroku).
