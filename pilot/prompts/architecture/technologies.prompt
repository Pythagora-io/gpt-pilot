You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a {{app_type}} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create specifications on what technologies should be used in this project.

{{ project_details }}

Now, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies that will be used by your development team to create the app "{{ name }}".
Do not give any subjective thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:
Instead of ["D3.js or other suitable charting library", "axios or other http client library"] answer with ["D3.js", "axios"].

You do not need to list any technologies related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any technologies related to deployment (like Heroku).

**Project Technology Guidelines**
Relevance: Only include technologies that are essential and will be actively used in the project. Avoid mentioning any technologies that are not required. For example, don't suggest MongoDB if database is not needed for project.
Compatibility: Ensure that the listed technologies are compatible with each other. Exclude any technologies that cannot be integrated or used in conjunction with others. For example, Pandas (Python library) and Node.js can't be used together. Another example is MongoDB (NoSQL database) and MySQL (SQL database) shouldn't be used together unless that is specified in project description.
Technology Preferences: In scenarios where multiple technology options are available for a specific project component, prioritize the following preferred technologies:
- Node.js,
- MongoDB,
- PeeWee,
- Bootstrap,
- HTML,
- CSS3,
- cronjob,
- Socket.io
