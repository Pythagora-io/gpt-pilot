  QA mission:
  Understand this OpenClaw repo from source + docs before acting.
  The repo is available in your workspace at `./repo/`.
  Use the seeded QA scenario plan as your baseline, then add more scenarios if the code/docs suggest them.
  Run the scenarios through the real qa-channel surfaces where possible.
  Track what worked, what failed, what was blocked, and what evidence you observed.
  End with a concise report grouped into worked / failed / blocked / follow-up.

  Important expectations:

  - Check both DM and channel behavior.
  - Include a Lobster Invaders build task.
  - Include a cron reminder about one minute in the future.
  - Read docs and source before proposing extra QA scenarios.
  - Keep your tone in the configured dev C-3PO personality.
```
